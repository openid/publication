<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>This document defines a set of requirements for the existing specifications to enable interoperability among Issuers, Wallets and Verifiers of Credentials where a high level of security and privacy is required. This document is an interoperability profile that can be used by implementations in various contexts, be it a certain industry or a certain regulatory environment.</t>
<t>This document is not a specification, but a profile. It refers to the specifications required for implementations to interoperate among each other and for the optionalities mentioned in the referenced specifications, defines the set of features to be mandatory to implement.</t>
<t>The profile uses OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref> and OpenID for Verifiable Presentations <xref target="OIDF.OID4VP"></xref> as the base protocols for issuance and presentation of Credentials, respectively. The credential formats used are IETF SD-JWT VC as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref> and ISO mdoc <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref>. Additionally, considerations are given on how the issuance of Credentials in both IETF SD-JWT VC <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref> and ISO mdoc <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref> formats can be performed in the same transaction.</t>
<t>A full list of the open standards used in this profile can be found in Overview of the Open Standards Requirements (reference).</t>

<section anchor="audience-target-audience-usage"><name>Audience Target audience/Usage</name>
<t>The audience of the document is implementers that require a high level of security and privacy for their solutions.

<section anchor="terminology"><name>Terminology</name>
<t>This specification uses the terms &quot;Holder&quot;, &quot;Issuer&quot;, &quot;Verifier&quot;, &quot;Wallet&quot;, and &quot;Verifiable Credential&quot; as defined in @!OIDF.OID4VCI] and <xref target="OIDF.OID4VP"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="standards-requirements"><name>Standards Requirements</name>
<t>This specification enables interoperable implementations of the following flows:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Issuance of IETF SD-JWT VC using OpenID4VCI</li>
<li>Presentation of IETF SD-JWT VC using OpenID4VP</li>
<li>Presentation of IETF SD-JWT VC using OpenID4VP over W3C Digital Credentials API</li>
<li>Presentation of ISO mdocs using OpenID4VP over W3C Digital Credentials API</li>
</ul>
<t>Implementations of this specification do not have to implement all of the flows listed above, but they MUST be compliant to all of the requirements for a particular flow they chose to implement.</t>
<t>A parameter that is listed as optional to be implemented in a specification that is being profiled (i.e., OpenID4VCI, OpenID4VP, W3C Digital Credentials API, IETF SD-JWT VC, and ISO mdoc) remains optional unless it is stated otherwise in this specification.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="openid-for-verifiable-credential-issuance"><name>OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance</name>
<t>Both the Wallet and the Credential Issuer:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>MUST support the authorization code flow.</li>
<li>MUST support protocol extensions for the SD-JWT VC credential format profile as defined in <xref target="vc_sd_jwt_profile"></xref>.</li>
<li>MUST support sender-constrained tokens using the mechanism defined in <xref target="RFC9449"></xref>.</li>
<li>MUST support <xref target="RFC7636"></xref> with <tt>S256</tt> as the code challenge method.</li>
</ul>
<t>Both Wallet initiated and Issuer initiated issuance is supported.</t>

<section anchor="credential-offer"><name>Credential Offer</name>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>The Grant Type <tt>authorization_code</tt> MUST be supported as defined in Section 4.1.1 in <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref></li>
<li>For Grant Type <tt>authorization_code</tt>, the Issuer MUST include a scope value in order to allow the Wallet to identify the desired Credential Type. The Wallet MUST use that value in the <tt>scope</tt> Authorization parameter.</li>
<li>As a way to invoke the Wallet, at least a custom URL scheme <tt>haip://</tt> MUST be supported. Implementations MAY support other ways to invoke the Wallets as agreed by trust frameworks/ecosystems/jurisdictions, not limited to using other custom URL schemes.</li>
</ul>
<t>Note: The Authorization Code flow does not require a Credential Offer from the Issuer to the Wallet. However, it is included in the feature set to allow for Issuer initiated Credential issuance.</t>
<t>Both sending Credential Offer same-device and cross-device is supported.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="authorization-endpoint"><name>Authorization Endpoint</name>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>MUST use Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR) <xref target="RFC9126"></xref> to send the Authorization Request.</li>
<li>Wallets MUST authenticate itself at the PAR endpoint using the same rules as defined in <xref target="token-endpoint"></xref> for client authentication at the token endpoint.</li>
<li>MUST use the <tt>scope</tt> parameter to communicate credential type(s) to be issued. The scope value MUST map to a specific Credential type. The scope value may be pre-agreed, obtained from the Credential Offer, or the Credential Issuer Metadata.</li>
<li>The <tt>client_id</tt> value in the PAR request MUST be a string that the Wallet has used as the <tt>sub</tt> value in the client attestation JWT.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section anchor="token-endpoint"><name>Token Endpoint</name>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>The Wallets MUST perform client authentication as defined in <xref target="wallet-attestation"></xref>.</li>
<li>Refresh tokens are RECOMMENDED to be supported for credential refresh. For details, see Section 13.5 in <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref>.</li>
</ul>
<t>Note: It is RECOMMENDED to use ephemeral client attestation JWTs for client authentication in order to prevent linkability across Credential Issuers.</t>
<t>Note: Issuers should be mindful of how long the usage of the refresh token is allowed to refresh a credential, as opposed to starting the issuance flow from the beginning. For example, if the User is trying to refresh a credential more than a year after its original issuance, the usage of the refresh tokens is NOT RECOMMENDED.</t>

<section anchor="wallet-attestation"><name>Wallet Attestation</name>
<t>Wallets MUST use wallet attestations as defined in Annex E of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref>.</t>

<li>The Issuer MUST NOT make any of the JWT Claims in the table above to be selectively disclosable, so that they are always present in the SD-JWT-VC presented by the Holder.</li>
<li>It is at the discretion of the Issuer whether to use <tt>exp</tt> claim and/or a <tt>status</tt> claim to express the validity period of an SD-JWT-VC. The Wallet and the verifier  MUST support both mechanisms.</li>
<li>The <tt>iss</tt> claim MUST be an HTTPS URL. The <tt>iss</tt> value is used to obtain Issuer’s signing key as defined in <xref target="issuer-key-resolution"></xref>.</li>

</ul>
<t>Note: Currently this profile only supports presentation of credentials with cryptographic Holder Binding: the holder's signature is required to proof the credential is presented by the holder it was issued to. This profile might support claim-based and biometrics-based holder binding once OpenID for Verifiable Credentials adds support for other forms of Holder Binding. See <eref target="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issues/1537/presenting-vc-without-a-vp-using-openid4vp">https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issues/1537/presenting-vc-without-a-vp-using-openid4vp</eref></t>
<t>Note: Re-using the same Credential across Verifiers, or re-using the same JWK value across multiple Credentials gives colluding Verifiers a mechanism to correlate the User. There are currently two known ways to address this with SD-JWT VCs. First is to issue multiple instances of the same credentials with different JWK values, so that if each instance of the credential is used at only one Verifier, it can be reused multiple times. Another is to use each credential only once (ephemeral credentials). It is RECOMMENDED to adopt one of these mechanisms.</t>
<t>Note: If there is a requirement to communicate information about the verification status and identity assurance data of the claims about the subject, the syntax defined by <xref target="OIDF.ekyc-ida"></xref> SHOULD be used. It is up to each jurisdiction and ecosystem, whether to require it to the implementers of this profile.</t>
<t>Note: If there is a requirement to provide the Subject’s identifier assigned and maintained by the Issuer, the <tt>sub</tt> claim MAY be used. There is no requirement for a binding to exist between the <tt>sub</tt> and <tt>cnf</tt> claims. See the Implementation Considerations section in <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref>.</t>
<t>Note: In some credential types, it is not desirable to include an expiration date (eg: diploma attestation). Therefore, this profile leaves its inclusion to the Issuer, or the body defining the respective credential type.</t>

<section anchor="issuer-key-resolution"><name>Issuer identification and key resolution to validate an issued Credential</name>
<t>This profile supports two ways to represent and resolve the key required to validate the issuer signature of an SD-JWT VC, the web PKI-based key resolution and the x.509 certificates.</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Web-based key resolution: The key used to validate the Issuer’s signature on the SD-JWT VC MUST be obtained from the SD-JWT VC issuer's metadata as defined in Section 5 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref>. The JOSE header <tt>kid</tt> MUST be used to identify the respective key.</li>
<li>x.509 certificates: the SD-JWT VC contains the issuer's certificate along with a trust chain in the <tt>x5c</tt> JOSE header. In this case, the <tt>iss</tt> value MUST be an URL with a FQDN matching a <tt>dNSName</tt> Subject Alternative Name (SAN) <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> entry in the leaf certificate.</li>
</ul>
<t>Note: The issuer MAY decide to support both options. In which case, it is at the discretion of the Wallet and the Verifier which key to use for the issuer signature validation.</t>
