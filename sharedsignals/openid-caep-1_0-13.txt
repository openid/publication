       OpenID Continuous Access Evaluation Profile 1.0 - draft 13
                            openid-caep-1_0

Abstract

   This document defines the Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP)
   of the Shared Signals Framework [SSF].  It specifies a set of event
   types conforming to the Shared Signals Framework.  These event types
   are intended to be used between cooperating Transmitters and
   Receivers such that Transmitters may send continuous updates using
   which Receivers can attenuate access to shared human or robotic
   users, devices, sessions and applications.

1.  Introduction

   CAEP is the application of the Shared Signals Profile of IETF
   Security Events 1.0 [SSF] (SSF Profile) to ensure access security in
   a network of cooperating providers.  CAEP specifies a set of event-
   types that conform to the SSF Profile.  This document specifies the
   event-types required to achieve this goal.

1.1.  Notational Considerations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Optional Event Claims

   The following claims are optional unless otherwise specified in the
   event definition.

   event_timestamp

      OPTIONAL, JSON number: the time at which the event described by
      this SET occurred.  Its value is a JSON number representing the
      number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until
      the date/time.

   initiating_entity

      OPTIONAL, JSON string: describes the entity that invoked the
      event.  This MUST be one of the following strings:

      -  admin: an administrative action triggered the event

      -  user: an end-user action triggered the event

      -  policy: a policy evaluation triggered the event

      -  system: a system or platform assertion triggered the event

   reason_admin

      OPTIONAL, JSON object: a localizable administrative message
      intended for logging and auditing.  The object MUST contain one or
      more key/value pairs, with a BCP47 [RFC5646] language tag as the
      key and the locale-specific administrative message as the value.

   {
       "reason_admin": {
           "en": "Landspeed Policy Violation: C076E82F",
           "de": "Landspeed-Richtlinienverstoss: C076E82F",
           "es-410": "Violacion de la politica de landspeed: C076E82F"
       }
   }

         Figure 1: Example: Administrative reason information with
                             multiple languages

   reason_user

      OPTIONAL, JSON object: a localizable user-friendly message for
      display to an end-user.  The object MUST contain one or more key/
      value pairs, with a BCP47 [RFC5646] language tag as the key and
      the locale-specific end-user message as the value.

   {
       "reason_user": {
           "en": "Access attempt from multiple regions.",
           "de": "Zugriffsversuch aus mehreren Regionen.",
           "es-410": "Intento de acceso desde varias regiones."
       }
   }

                                 languages

3.  Event Types

   The base URI for CAEP event types is:

   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/caep/event-type/

3.1.  Session Revoked

   Event Type URI:

                                CAEP-Spec                       May 2025


   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/caep/event-type/session-revoked

   Session Revoked signals that the session identified by the subject
   has been revoked.  The explicit session identifier may be directly
   referenced in the subject or other properties of the session may be
   included to allow the receiver to identify applicable sessions.

   When a Complex Claim is used as the subject, the revocation event
   applies to any session derived from matching those combined claims.

   The actual reason why the session was revoked might be specified with
   the nested reason_admin and/or reason_user claims described in
   Section 2.

3.1.1.  Event-Specific Claims

   There are no event-specific claims for this event type.

   When event_timestamp is included, its value MUST represent the time
   at which the session revocation occurred.

3.1.2.  Examples

   NOTE: The event type URI is wrapped, the backslash is the
   continuation character.

3.3.  Credential Change

   Event Type URI:

   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/caep/event-type/credential-change

   The Credential Change event signals that a credential was created,
   changed, revoked or deleted.  Credential Change scenarios include:

   *  password/PIN change/reset

   *  certificate enrollment, renewal, revocation and deletion

3.4.  Assurance Level Change

   Event Type URI:

   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/caep/event-type/assurance-level-
   change

   The Assurance Level Change event signals that there has been a change
   in authentication method since the initial user login.  This change
   can be from a weak authentication method to a strong authentication
   method, or vice versa.

   In the first scenario, Assurance Level Change will an increase, while
   in the second scenario it will be a decrease.  For example, a user
   can start a session with Service Provider A using single factor
   authentication (such as a password).  The user can then open another
   session with Service Provider B using two-factor authentication (such
   as OTP).  In this scenario an increase Assurance Level Change event
   will signal to Service Provider A that user has authenticated with a
   stronger authentication method.

   The actual reason why the assurance level changed might be specified
   with the nested reason_admin and/or reason_user claims made in
   Section 2.

3.8.  Risk Level Change

   Event Type URI:

   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/caep/event-type/risk-level-change

   A vendor may deploy mechanisms to gather and analyze various signals
   associated with subjects such as users, devices, etc.  These signals,
   which can originate from diverse channels and methods beyond the
   scope of this event description, are processed to derive an
   abstracted risk level representing the subject's current threat
   status.

   The Risk Level Change event is employed by the Transmitter to
   communicate any modifications in a subject's assessed risk level at
   the time indicated by the event_timestamp field in the Risk Level
   Change event.  The Transmitter may generate this event to indicate:

   *  User's risk has changed due to potential suspecious access from
      unknown destination, password compromise, addition of strong
      authenticator or other reasons.

   *  Device's risk has changed due to installation of unapproved
      software, connection to insecure pheripheral device, encryption of
      data or other reasons.

   *  Any other subject's risk changes due to variety of reasons.

3.8.1.  Event Specific Claims

   risk_reason

      RECOMMENDED, JSON string: indicates the reason that contributed to
      the risk level changes by the Transmitter.

   principal

      REQUIRED, JSON string: representing the principal entity involved
      in the observed risk event, as identified by the transmitter.  The
      subject principal can be one of the following entities USER,
      DEVICE, SESSION, TENANT, ORG_UNIT, GROUP, or any other entity as
      defined in Section 2 of [SSF].  This claim identifies the primary
      subject associated with the event, and helps to contextualize the
      risk relative to the entity involved.

   current_level

      REQUIRED, JSON string: indicates the current level of the risk for
      the subject.  Value MUST be one of LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH

   previous_level

      OPTIONAL, JSON string: indicates the previously known level of the
      risk for the subject.  Value MUST be one of LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH.  If
      the Transmitter omits this value, the Receiver MUST assume that
      the previous risk level is unknown to the Transmitter.
