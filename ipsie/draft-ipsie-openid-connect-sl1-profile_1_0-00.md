# Introduction

TODO Introduction


# Conventions and Definitions

The keywords "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not", "may", and "can" in
this document are to be interpreted as described in ISO Directive Part 2
[ISODIR2]. These keywords are not used as dictionary terms such that any
occurrence of them shall be interpreted as keywords and are not to be
interpreted with their natural language meanings.

## Roles

This document uses the term "Identity Provider" to refer to the "OpenID Provider" in [OpenID] and the "Authorization Server" in [RFC6749].

This document uses the term "Application" to refer to the "Relying Party" in [OpenID] and the "Client" in [RFC6749].


# Profile

## Network Layer Requirements

### Requirements for all endpoints

To protect against network attacks, clients, authorization servers, and resource servers

* shall only offer TLS protected endpoints and shall establish connections to other servers using TLS;
* shall set up TLS connections using TLS version 1.2 or later;
* shall follow the recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security in [BCP195];
* should use DNSSEC to protect against DNS spoofing attacks that can lead to the issuance of rogue domain-validated TLS certificates; and
* shall perform a TLS server certificate check, as per [RFC9525].

### Requirements for endpoints not used by web browsers

For server-to-server communication endpoints that are not used by web browsers, the following requirements apply:

* When using TLS 1.2, servers shall only permit the cipher suites recommended in [BCP195];
* When using TLS 1.2, clients should only permit the cipher suites recommended in [BCP195].

### Requirements for endpoints used by web browsers

For endpoints that are used by web browsers, the following additional requirements apply:

* Servers shall use methods to ensure that connections cannot be downgraded using TLS stripping attacks. A preloaded [preload] HTTP Strict Transport Security policy [RFC6797] can be used for this purpose. Some top-level domains, like .bank and .insurance, have set such a policy and therefore protect all second-level domains below them.
* When using TLS 1.2, servers shall only use cipher suites allowed in [BCP195].
* Servers shall not support [CORS] for the authorization endpoint, as clients must perform an HTTP redirect rather than access this endpoint directly.


## Cryptography and Secrets

The following requirements apply to cryptographic operations and secrets:

* Authorization servers, clients, and resource servers when creating or processing JWTs shall:
  * adhere to [RFC8725];
  * use PS256, ES256, or EdDSA (using the Ed25519 variant) algorithms; and
  * not use or accept the `none` algorithm.
* RSA keys shall have a minimum length of 2048 bits.
* Elliptic curve keys shall have a minimum length of 224 bits.
* Credentials not intended for handling by end-users (e.g., access tokens, refresh tokens, authorization codes, etc.) shall be created with at least 128 bits of entropy such that an attacker correctly guessing the value is computationally infeasible ({{Section 10.10 of RFC6749}}).

## OpenID Connect

In the following, a profile of the following technologies is defined:

* OpenID Connect Core 1.0 incorporating errata set 2 [OpenID.Discovery]
* OpenID Connect Discovery [OpenID.Discovery]
* OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC6749]
* Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) [RFC7636]
* OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata [RFC8414]
* OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) [RFC9449]
* OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Issuer Identification [RFC9207]


### Requirements for OpenID Providers

OpenID Providers:

* shall distribute discovery metadata (such as the authorization endpoint) via the metadata document as specified in [OpenID.Discovery];
* shall reject requests using the resource owner password credentials grant;
* shall support public clients as defined in [RFC6749];
* shall not expose open redirectors {{Section 4.11 of RFC9700}};
* shall only accept its issuer identifier value (as defined in [RFC8414]) as a string in the `aud` claim received in client authentication assertions;
* shall issue authorization codes with a maximum lifetime of 60 seconds;
* shall require clients to be preregistered, and shall not support unauthenticated Dynamic Client Registration requests (see Note 1);
* shall require clients to pre-register their redirect URIs

Access Tokens issued by OpenID Providers:

* shall only be used by the RP to retrieve identity claims at the OpenID Provider;
* shall only issue sender-constrained access tokens using DPoP [RFC9449];

ID Tokens issued by OpenID Providers:

* shall contain the OAuth Client ID of the RP as a single audience value as a string (see Note 2);
* shall contain `acr` claim as a string that identifies the Authentication Context Class that the authentication performed satisfied, as described in Section 2 of [OpenID];
* shall contain the `amr` claim as an array of strings indicating identifiers for authentication methods used in the authentication from those registered in the IANA Authentication Method Reference Values registry, as described in Section 2 of [OpenID];
* shall indicate the expected lifetime of the RP session in the `session_lifetime` claim in seconds (see Note 3);

Note 1: The requirement for preregistered clients corresponds to Section 3.4 "Trust Agreements" of [NIST.FAL].

Note 2: The audience value must be a single string to meet the audience restriction of [NIST.FAL].

Note 3: This claim is not currently defined in OpenID Connect, and should be pulled out into its own spec in OpenID Core instead of being defined here.


For the authorization code flow, OpenID Providers:

* shall require the value of `response_type` described in [RFC6749] to be `code`;
* shall require PKCE [RFC7636] with S256 as the code challenge method (see Note 1 below);
* shall require an exact match of a registered redirect URI as described in {{Section 2.1 of RFC9700}};
* shall issue authorization codes with a maximum lifetime of 60 seconds;
* shall support "Authorization Code Binding to DPoP Key" (as required by {{Section 10.1 of RFC9449}});
* shall return an iss parameter in the authorization response according to [RFC9207];
* shall not transmit authorization responses over unencrypted network connections, and, to this end, shall not allow redirect URIs that use the "http" scheme;
* shall reject an authorization code (Section 1.3.1 of [RFC6749]) if it has been previously used;
* shall not use the HTTP 307 status code when redirecting a request that contains user credentials to avoid forwarding the credentials to a third party accidentally (see {{Section 4.12 of RFC9700}});
* should use the HTTP 303 status code when redirecting the user agent using status codes;
* shall support `nonce` parameter values up to 64 characters in length, may reject `nonce` values longer than 64 characters.


Note 1: while both nonce and PKCE can provide protection from authorization code injection, nonce relies on the client (RP) to implement and enforce the check, and the IdP is unable to verify that it has been implemented correctly, and only stops the attack after tokens have already been issued. Instead, PKCE is enforced by the IdP and stops the attack before tokens are issued.



### Requirements for OpenID Relying Parties

OpenID Relying Parties:

* shall support third-party initiated login as defined in Section 4 of [OpenID];
* shall use the authorization server's issuer identifier value (as defined in [RFC8414]) in the `aud` claim in client authentication assertions. The issuer identifier value shall be sent as a string not as an item in an array;
* shall not expose open redirectors (see {{Section 4.11 of RFC9700}});
* shall only use authorization server metadata (such as the authorization endpoint) retrieved from the metadata document as specified in [OpenID.Discovery] and [RFC8414];
* shall ensure that the issuer URL used as the basis for retrieving the authorization server metadata is obtained from an authoritative source and using a secure channel, such that it cannot be modified by an attacker;
* shall ensure that this issuer URL and the issuer value in the obtained metadata match;

OpenID Relying Parties making resource requests to the OpenID Provider:

* shall support sender-constrined access tokens using DPoP as described in [RFC9449];
* shall support the server-provided nonce mechanism (as defined in {{Section 8 of RFC9449}});
* shall send access tokens in the HTTP header as described in {{Section 7.1 of RFC9449}};
* shall support refresh tokens and their rotation;

For the authorization code flow, Relying Parties:

* shall use the authorization code grant described in [RFC6749];
* shall use PKCE [RFC7636] with S256 as the code challenge method;
* shall generate the PKCE challenge specifically for each authorization request and securely bind the challenge to the client and the user agent in which the flow was started;
* shall check the iss parameter in the authorization response according to [RFC9207] to prevent mix-up attacks;
* should not use `nonce` parameter values longer than 64 characters;
