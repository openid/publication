<?line 95?>

<t>The Authorization API enables Policy Decision Points (PDPs) and Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs) to communicate authorization requests and decisions to each other without requiring knowledge of each other's inner workings. The Authorization API is served by the PDP and is called by the PEP. The Authorization API includes evaluation endpoints, which provide specific access decisions, and search endpoints for discovering permissible subjects, resources, or actions.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>Computational services often implement access control within their components by separating Policy Decision Points (PDPs) from Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs). PDPs and PEPs are defined in XACML (<xref target="XACML"/>) and NIST's ABAC SP 800-162 (<xref target="NIST.SP.800-162"/>). Communication between PDPs and PEPs follows similar patterns across different software and services that require or provide authorization information. The Authorization API described in this document enables different providers to offer PDP and PEP capabilities without having to bind themselves to one particular implementation of a PDP or PEP.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="model"><name>Model</name>
<t>By convention, we refer to a service that implements this API as a Policy Decision Point, or PDP. The policy language, architecture, and state management aspects of a PDP are beyond the scope of this specification.</t>

<t>By convention, we refer to a client of the Authorization API as a Policy Enforcement Point, or PEP. Clients may consume the Authorization API for use cases that go beyond enforcement of authorization decisions; for example, the Resource Search API (<xref target="resource-search-api"/>) allows a caller to discover the resources on which a subject can perform an action. For consistency, we use the term PEP to describe a client of the API, regardless of the use case.</t>

<t>The Authorization API is defined in a transport-agnostic manner. A normative HTTPS binding is described in Transport (<xref target="transport"/>). Other bindings, such as gRPC, may be defined in other profiles of this specification.</t>

<t>Authentication for the Authorization API itself is out of scope for this document, since authentication for APIs is well-documented elsewhere. Support for OAuth 2.0 (<xref target="RFC6749"/>) is RECOMMENDED.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="features"><name>Features</name>
<t>The core feature of the Authorization API is the Access Evaluation API (<xref target="access-evaluation-api"/>), which enables a PEP to determine whether a specific request can be permitted to access a specific resource. The following are non-normative examples:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Can Alice view document #123?</t>
  <t>Can Alice view document #123 at 16:30 on Tuesday, June 11, 2024?</t>
  <t>Can a manager print?</t>
</list></t>

<t>The Access Evaluations API (<xref target="access-evaluations-api"/>) enables execution of multiple evaluations in a single request. The following are non-normative examples:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Can Alice view documents 123, 234 and 345 on Tuesday, June 11, 2024?</t>
  <t>Can document 123 be viewed by Alice and Bob?</t>
</list></t>

<t>The Search APIs (<xref target="search"/>) provide lists of resources, subjects or actions that would be allowed access. The following are non-normative examples:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Which documents can Alice view?</t>
  <t>Who can view document 123?</t>
  <t>What actions can Alice perform on document 123 on Tuesday, June 11, 2024?</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="api-version"><name>API Version</name>
<t>This document describes the API version 1.0. Any updates to this API through subsequent revisions of this document or other documents MAY augment this API, but MUST NOT modify the API described here. Augmentation MAY include additional API methods or additional parameters to existing API methods, additional authorization mechanisms, or additional optional headers in HTTPS transport bindings. Endpoints for version 1.0 SHOULD include <spanx style="verb">v1</spanx> in the endpoint identifier (e.g. <spanx style="verb">https://pdp.example.com/access/v1/</spanx>).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="information-model"><name>Information Model</name>
<t>The information model for requests and responses include the following entities: Subject, Action, Resource, Context, and Decision. These are all defined below.</t>

<section anchor="subject"><name>Subject</name>
<t>A Subject is the user or machine principal about whom the Authorization API is being invoked. The Subject may be requesting access at the time the Authorization API is invoked.</t>

<t>A Subject is an object that contains two REQUIRED keys, <spanx style="verb">type</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">id</spanx>, which have a string value, and an OPTIONAL key, <spanx style="verb">properties</spanx>, with a value of an object.</t>

<dl>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">type</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>REQUIRED. A string value that specifies the type of the Subject.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">id</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>REQUIRED. A string value containing the unique identifier of the Subject, scoped to the <spanx style="verb">type</spanx>.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">properties</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>OPTIONAL. An object which can be used to express additional attributes of a Subject.</t>
  </dd>
</dl>

<section anchor="subject-properties"><name>Subject Properties</name>
<t>Many authorization systems are stateless, and expect the PEP to pass in all relevant attributes used in the evaluation of the authorization policy. To satisfy this requirement, Subjects MAY include additional attributes as key-value pairs, under the <spanx style="verb">properties</spanx> object. A property can contain both simple values, such as strings, numbers, booleans and nulls, and complex values, such as arrays and objects.</t>

<t>Examples of subject attributes can include, but are not limited to:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>department,</t>
  <t>group memberships,</t>
  <t>device identifier,</t>
  <t>IP address.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="subject-examples"><name>Examples (non-normative)</name>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a minimal Subject:</t>

<figure title="Example Subject" anchor="subject-example"><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[

  }
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="resource"><name>Resource</name>
<t>A Resource is the target of an access request. It is an object that is constructed similar to a Subject entity. It has the following keys:</t>

<dl>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">type</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>REQUIRED. A string value that specifies the type of the Resource.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">id</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>REQUIRED. A string value containing the unique identifier of the Resource, scoped to the <spanx style="verb">type</spanx>.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">properties</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>OPTIONAL. An object which can be used to express additional attributes of a Resource.</t>
  </dd>
</dl>

<section anchor="resource-properties"><name>Resource Properties</name>

<t>Similarly to the Subject properties, the PEP can also provide attributes for the Resource in the properties field.</t>

<t>Such attributes can include, but are not limited to, attributes of the resource used in access evaluations or metadata about the resource.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="resource-examples"><name>Examples (non-normative)</name>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a Resource with a <spanx style="verb">type</spanx> and a simple <spanx style="verb">id</spanx>:</t>

]]></sourcecode></figure>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="action"><name>Action</name>
<t>An Action is the type of access that the requester intends to perform.</t>

<t>Action is an object that contains a REQUIRED <spanx style="verb">name</spanx> key with a string value, and an OPTIONAL <spanx style="verb">properties</spanx> key with an object value.</t>

<dl>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">name</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>REQUIRED. A string value containing the name of the Action.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">properties</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>OPTIONAL. An object which can be used to express additional attributes of an Action.</t>
  </dd>
</dl>

<section anchor="action-properties"><name>Action Properties</name>

<t>Similarly to the Subject and Resource properties, the PEP can also provide attributes for the Action in the properties field.</t>

<t>Such attributes can include, but are not limited to, parameters of the action that is being requested.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="action-examples"><name>Examples (non-normative)</name>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of an action:</t>

<figure title="Example Action" anchor="action-example"><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="context"><name>Context</name>
<t>The Context represents the environment of the access evaluation request.</t>

<t>Context is an object which can be used to express attributes of the environment.</t>

<t>Examples of context attributes can include, but are not limited to:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The time of day,</t>
  <t>Location from which the request was received,</t>
  <t>Capabilities of the PEP,</t>
  <t>JSON Schema or JSON-LD definitions for the request.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="decision"><name>Decision</name>
<t>A Decision is the result of the evaluation of an access request. It provides the information required for the PEP to enforce the decision.</t>

<t>Decision is an object that contains a REQUIRED <spanx style="verb">decision</spanx> key with a <spanx style="verb">boolean</spanx> value, and an OPTIONAL <spanx style="verb">context</spanx> key with an object value.</t>

<dl>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">decision</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>REQUIRED. A boolean value that specifies whether the Decision is to allow or deny the operation.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">context</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>OPTIONAL. An object which can convey additional information that can be used by the PEP as part of the decision enforcement process.</t>
  </dd>
</dl>

<t>In this specification, assuming the evaluation was successful, there are only two possible values for the <spanx style="verb">decision</spanx>:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><spanx style="verb">true</spanx>: The access request is permitted to go forward. If the PEP does not understand information in the <spanx style="verb">context</spanx> response object, the PEP MAY choose to reject the decision.</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">false</spanx>: The access request is denied and MUST NOT be permitted to go forward.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a minimal Decision:</t>

<figure title="Example Decision" anchor="decision-example"><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[
{
  "decision": true
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<section anchor="decision-context"><name>Decision Context</name>
<t>In addition to a <spanx style="verb">decision</spanx>, a response MAY contain a <spanx style="verb">context</spanx> field which contains an object. This context can convey additional information that can be used by the PEP as part of the decision enforcement process.</t>

<t>Examples include, but are not limited to:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Reason(s) a decision was made,</t>
  <t>"Advices" and/or "Obligations" tied to the access decision,</t>
  <t>Hints for rendering UI state,</t>

  <t>Environmental information,</t>
  <t>etc.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="decision-examples"><name>Examples (non-normative)</name>
<t>The following are all non-normative examples of possible and valid contexts, provided to illustrate possible usages. The actual semantics and format of the <spanx style="verb">context</spanx> object are an implementation concern and outside the scope of this specification. For example, implementations MAY use keys that correspond to concepts from other standards, such as HTTP status codes, to convey common reasons in an interoperable manner.</t>

<section anchor="non-normative-example-1-conveying-decision-reasons"><name>Non-normative Example 1: conveying decision Reasons</name>
<t>The PDP may provide reasons to explain a decision. In the non-normative example below, an implementation might convey different reasons to administrators and end-users, using keys that could correspond to HTTP status codes:</t>

<t>The response of the Access Evaluation API consists of the Decision entity as defined in the Information Model (<xref target="information-model"/>).</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="access-evaluations-api"><name>Access Evaluations API</name>

<t>The Access Evaluations API defines the message exchange pattern between a PEP and a PDP for evaluating multiple access evaluations within the scope of a single message exchange (also known as "boxcarring" requests).</t>

<section anchor="access-evaluations-request"><name>The Access Evaluations API Request</name>

<t>The Access Evaluation API Request builds on the information model presented in <xref target="information-model"/> and the object defined in the Access Evaluation Request (<xref target="access-evaluation-request"/>).</t>

<t>To send multiple access evaluation requests in a single message, the PEP MAY add an <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> key to the request. The <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> key is an array which contains a list of objects, each typed as the object as defined in the Access Evaluation Request (<xref target="access-evaluation-request"/>), and specifying a discrete request.</t>

<t>If an <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> array is NOT present or is empty, the Access Evaluations Request behaves in a backwards-compatible manner with the (single) Access Evaluation API Request (<xref target="access-evaluation-request"/>).</t>

<t>If an <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> array IS present and contains one or more objects, these form distinct requests that the PDP will evaluate. These requests are independent from each other, and may be executed sequentially or in parallel, left to the discretion of each implementation.</t>

<t>The top-level <spanx style="verb">subject</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">action</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">resource</spanx>, and <spanx style="verb">context</spanx> keys provide default values for their respective fields in the <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> array.  The top-level <spanx style="verb">subject</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">action</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">resource</spanx> keys MAY be omitted if the <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> array is present, contains one or more objects, and every object in the <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> array contains the respective top-level key. This behavior is described in <xref target="default-values"/>.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example for specifying three requests, with no default values:</t>

<figure><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[

  "evaluations": [

<section anchor="default-values"><name>Default values</name>

<t>While the example above provides the most flexibility in specifying distinct values in each request for every evaluation, it is common for boxcarred requests to share one or more values of the evaluation request. For example, evaluations MAY all refer to a single subject, and/or have the same contextual (environmental) attributes.</t>

<t>Default values offer a more compact syntax that avoids unnecessary duplication of request data.</t>

<t>The top-level <spanx style="verb">subject</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">action</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">resource</spanx>, and <spanx style="verb">context</spanx> keys provide default values for each object in the evaluations array. Any of these keys specified within an individual evaluation object overrides the corresponding top-level default. Because <spanx style="verb">subject</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">action</spanx>, and <spanx style="verb">resource</spanx> are required for a valid evaluation, any of these keys omitted from an evaluation object MUST be provided as a top-level key.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example for specifying three requests that refer to a single subject and context:</t>

<t>The <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> request payload includes an OPTIONAL <spanx style="verb">options</spanx> key, with a value that is an object.</t>

<t>This provides a general-purpose mechanism for providing PEP-supplied metadata on how the request is to be executed.</t>

<t>One such option controls <em>evaluation semantics</em>, and is described in <xref target="evaluations-semantics"/>.</t>

<t>A non-normative example of the <spanx style="verb">options</spanx> field is shown below, following an <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> array provided for the sake of completeness:</t>

<figure><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[
{
  "evaluations": [{
    "resource": {
      "type": "doc",
      "id": "1"
    },

      "type": "doc",
      "id": "2"
    }
  }],
  "options": {
    "evaluations_semantic": "execute_all",
    "another_option": "value"
  }
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<section anchor="evaluations-semantics"><name>Evaluations semantics</name>

<t>By default, every request in the <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> array is executed and a response returned in the same array order. This is the most common use-case for boxcarring multiple evaluation requests in a single payload.</t>

<t>This specification supports three evaluation semantics:</t>

<t><list style="numbers" type="1">
  <t><em>Execute all of the requests (potentially in parallel), return all of the results.</em> Any failure can be denoted by <spanx style="verb">"decision": false</spanx> and MAY provide a reason code in the context.</t>
  <t><em>Deny on first denial (or failure).</em> This semantic could be desired if a PEP wants to issue a few requests in a particular order, with any denial (error, or <spanx style="verb">"decision": false</spanx>) "short-circuiting" the evaluations call and returning on the first denial. This essentially works like the <spanx style="verb">&amp;&amp;</spanx> operator in programming languages.</t>
  <t><em>Permit on first permit.</em> This is the converse "short-circuiting" semantic, working like the <spanx style="verb">||</spanx> operator in programming languages.</t>
</list></t>

<t>To select the desired evaluation semantic, a PEP can pass in <spanx style="verb">options.evaluations_semantic</spanx> with exactly one of the following values:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><spanx style="verb">execute_all</spanx></t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">deny_on_first_deny</spanx></t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">permit_on_first_permit</spanx></t>
</list></t>

<t><spanx style="verb">execute_all</spanx> is the default semantic, so an <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> request without the <spanx style="verb">options.evaluations_semantic</spanx> flag will execute using this semantic.</t>

<section anchor="access-evaluations-response"><name>The Access Evaluations API Response</name>

<t>Like the request format, the Access Evaluations Response format for an Access Evaluations Request adds an <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> array that lists the decisions in the same order they were provided in the <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> array in the request. Each value of the evaluations array is typed as a Decision as defined in the Information Model (<xref target="information-model"/>).</t>

<t>In case the <spanx style="verb">evaluations</spanx> array is present, it is RECOMMENDED that the <spanx style="verb">decision</spanx> key of the response be omitted. If present, it can be ignored by the PEP.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a Access Evaluations Response to an Access Evaluations Request containing three evaluation objects:</t>

<figure><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[
{
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "decision": true
    },
    {
      "decision": false,
      "context": {
        "reason": "resource not found"
      }
    },
    {
      "decision": false,
      "context": {
        "reason": "Subject is a viewer of the resource"
      }
    }
  ]
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<section anchor="errors"><name>Errors</name>

<t>There are two types of errors, and they are handled differently:
1. Transport-level errors, or errors that pertain to the entire payload.
2. Errors in individual evaluations.</t>

<t>The first type of error is handled at the transport level. For example, for the HTTP binding, the 4XX and 5XX codes indicate a general error that pertains to the entire payload, as described in Transport (<xref target="transport"/>).</t>

<t>The second type of error is handled at the payload level. Decisions default to <em>closed</em> (i.e. <spanx style="verb">false</spanx>), but the <spanx style="verb">context</spanx> field can include errors that are specific to that request.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a response to an Access Evaluations Request containing three evaluation objects, two of them demonstrating how errors can be returned for two of the evaluation requests:</t>

<figure><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[
{
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "decision": true
    },
    {
      "decision": false,
      "context": {
        "error": {
          "status": 404,
          "message": "Resource not found"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "decision": false,
      "context": {
        "reason": "Subject is a viewer of the resource"
      }
    }
  ]
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

</section>
</section>
</section>
<section anchor="search"><name>Search APIs</name>

<t>The Search APIs enable a PEP to discover the set of subjects, resources, or actions that are permitted within a specific authorization context. Their purpose is to return a list of authorized entities, rather than verify a single access request.</t>

<t>To perform a search, the PEP provides the Subject, Resource, Action, and Context entities defined in the Information Model (<xref target="information-model"/>), but omits the unique identifier of the entity being queried. The PDP then responds with the set of authorized entities for the queried entity type which would be authorized according to the provided criteria.</t>

<section anchor="search-semantics"><name>Semantics</name>

<t>A search is designed to return entities that would correspond to a permitted decision. Therefore, any result from a Search API, when subsequently used in an Access Evaluation API call, SHOULD result in a <spanx style="verb">"decision": true</spanx> response. However, because the evaluation is implementation-specific and may depend on other variables (such as time), this outcome is not guaranteed.</t>

<t>In addition, it is RECOMMENDED that a search be performed transitively, traversing intermediate attributes and/or relationships. For example, if user U is a member of group G, and group G is designated as a viewer on a document D, then a search for all subjects of type user that can view document D will include user U.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="search-pagination"><name>Pagination</name>

<t>Search APIs can return large result sets. To manage this, a PDP MAY support pagination, allowing a PEP to navigate and retrieve subsets of the total result set.</t>

<t>Pagination does not guarantee an atomic snapshot of the result set. Consequently, if items are added or removed while paginating, results MAY be repeated or omitted between pages.</t>

<t>Pagination is based on the use of opaque tokens. A PEP makes an initial request for data by sending a query that does not contain a token. If the PDP determines that the result set contains too many results to fit in a single response, the PDP returns a partial result set and a token that the PEP can use to retrieve the next page of results.</t>

<t>A paginated response MUST be clearly identified by the inclusion of a <spanx style="verb">page</spanx> object containing a non-empty, opaque <spanx style="verb">next_token</spanx>. This token is the signal to the PEP that more results are available.</t>

<t>To retrieve the next page, the PEP sends a subsequent request containing a <spanx style="verb">page</spanx> object with the <spanx style="verb">token</spanx> field set to the <spanx style="verb">next_token</spanx> value from the previous response. This process is repeated until the PDP returns a <spanx style="verb">page</spanx> object in which the value of the <spanx style="verb">next_token</spanx> field is an empty string, signaling the end of the result set.</t>

<t>When a request contains a token, all entities (e.g., <spanx style="verb">subject</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">resource</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">action</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">context</spanx>) and pagination parameters (e.g., <spanx style="verb">limit</spanx>)  MUST be identical to the preceding request. PDPs SHOULD return an error when any entity or parameter has been changed.</t>

<t>PEPs that wish to sequentially iterate through the entire result set SHOULD use the core pagination mechanism described above, which is designed to work consistently across all PDPs that support the search APIs.</t>

<section anchor="search-pagination-request"><name>Paginated Requests</name>

<t>A Search API Request MAY include a <spanx style="verb">page</spanx> object indicating which subset of the larger result set the PEP would like to receive.</t>

<t>The <spanx style="verb">page</spanx> object in a Search API Request consists of the following keys:</t>

<dl>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">token</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>OPTIONAL. An opaque string value from the <spanx style="verb">next_token</spanx> of a previous response.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">limit</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>OPTIONAL. A non-negative integer indicating the maximum number of results to return in the response.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">properties</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>OPTIONAL. An object containing additional implementation-specific pagination request attributes, such as, but not limited to, sorting and filtering.</t>
  </dd>
</dl>

<t>Apart from the <spanx style="verb">token</spanx>, all values from the initial request MUST remain identical for subsequent pages. If a different value is provided mid-pagination the PDP SHOULD return an error.</t>

<t>Additional keys MAY be included in the <spanx style="verb">page</spanx> object. If they are, they MUST be defined in a specification referenced in the AuthZEN Policy Decision Point Capabilities Registry (<xref target="iana-pdp-capabilities-registry"/>). Furthermore, the PDP MUST declare support for the corresponding capability URN in its <spanx style="verb">supported_capabilities</spanx> metadata (<xref target="pdp-metadata-data-capabilities"/>).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="search-pagination-response"><name>Paginated Responses</name>

<t>Any Search API Response MAY include a <spanx style="verb">page</spanx> object, but if a response does not contain the entire result set, it MUST include this object.</t>

<t>The <spanx style="verb">page</spanx> object contains the following keys:</t>

<dl>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">next_token</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>REQUIRED. An opaque string value indicating the next page of results to return. If there are no more results after this page, its value MUST be an empty string.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">count</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>OPTIONAL. A non-negative integer indicating the number of results included in this response. When included at the start of a response, as described in the Search API Response (<xref target="search-response"/>), this enables a PEP to display a progress indicator when processing large or slow responses.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">total</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>OPTIONAL. A non-negative integer indicating the total number of results matching the query criteria at the time of the request. This value is not guaranteed to equal the total number of items returned across all pages if the underlying data set changes during pagination.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">properties</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>OPTIONAL. An object containing additional pagination response attributes. Examples include, but are not limited to, estimated totals or the number of remaining results.</t>

<t>The following Policy Decision Point metadata parameters are used by this specification and are registered in the IANA "AuthZEN Policy Decision Point Metadata" registry established in <xref target="iana-pdp-metadata-registry"/>.</t>

<section anchor="pdp-metadata-data-endpoint"><name>Endpoint Parameters</name>

<dl>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">policy_decision_point</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>REQUIRED. The Policy Decision Point identifier, which is a URL that uses the "https" scheme and has no query or fragment components. Policy Decision Point metadata is published at a location that is ".well-known" according to <xref target="RFC8615"/> derived from this Policy Decision Point identifier, as described in <xref target="pdp-metadata-access"/>. The Policy Decision Point identifier is used to prevent Policy Decision Point mix-up attacks.</t>
  </dd>

<section anchor="pdp-metadata-data-capabilities"><name>Capabilities Parameters</name>

<dl>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">capabilities</spanx>:</dt>

</section>
<section anchor="pdp-metadata-data-sig"><name>Signature Parameter</name>

<t>In addition to JSON elements, metadata parameters MAY also be provided as a <spanx style="verb">signed_metadata</spanx> value, which is a JSON Web Token <xref target="RFC7519"/> that asserts metadata values about the PDP as a bundle. A set of metadata parameters that can be used in signed metadata as claims are defined in <xref target="pdp-metadata-data-endpoint"/>. The signed metadata MUST be digitally signed or MACed using JSON Web Signature <xref target="RFC7515"/> and MUST contain an <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> (issuer) claim denoting the party attesting to the claims in the signed metadata.</t>

<t>A PEP MAY ignore the signed metadata if they do not support this feature. If the PEP supports signed metadata, metadata values conveyed in the signed metadata MUST take precedence over the corresponding values conveyed using plain JSON elements. Signed metadata is included in the Policy Decision Point metadata JSON object using this OPTIONAL metadata parameter:</t>

<dl>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">signed_metadata</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>A JWT containing metadata parameters about the protected resource as claims. This is a string value consisting of the entire signed JWT. A <spanx style="verb">signed_metadata</spanx> parameter SHOULD NOT appear as a claim in the JWT; it is RECOMMENDED to reject any metadata in which this occurs.</t>
  </dd>
</dl>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="pdp-metadata-access"><name>Obtaining Policy Decision Point Metadata</name>

<t>PDPs supporting metadata MUST make a JSON document containing metadata as specified in the AuthZEN Policy Decision Point Metadata Registry (<xref target="iana-pdp-metadata-registry"/>) available at a URL formed by inserting a well-known URI string between the host component and the path and/or query components, if any. The well-known URI string used is <spanx style="verb">/.well-known/authzen-configuration</spanx>.</t>

<t>The syntax and semantics of .well-known are defined in <xref target="RFC8615"/>. The well-known URI path suffix used is registered in the IANA "Well-Known URIs" registry <xref target="IANA.well-known-uris"/>.</t>

<t>An example of a PDP supporting multiple tenants will have a discovery endpoint as follows:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
https://pdp.example.com/.well-known/authzen-configuration/tenant1
]]></artwork></figure>

<section anchor="pdp-metadata-access-request"><name>Policy Decision Point Metadata Request</name>

<t>A Policy Decision Point metadata document MUST be queried using an HTTP GET request at the previously specified URL. The consumer of the metadata would make the following request when the resource identifier is https://pdp.example.com:</t>

<figure><sourcecode type="http"><![CDATA[
GET /.well-known/authzen-configuration HTTP/1.1
Host: pdp.example.com
]]></sourcecode></figure>

</section>
<section anchor="pdp-metadata-access-response"><name>Policy Decision Point Metadata Response</name>

<t>The response is a set of metadata parameters about the protected resource's configuration.</t>

<t>A successful response MUST use the HTTP status code <spanx style="verb">200</spanx> and a <spanx style="verb">Content-Type</spanx> of <spanx style="verb">application/json</spanx>. Its body MUST be a JSON object that contains a set of metadata parameters as defined in the AuthZEN Policy Decision Point Metadata Registry (<xref target="iana-pdp-metadata-registry"/>).</t>

<t>Any metadata parameters in the response that are not understood by the PEP MUST be ignored.</t>

<t>Parameters that have multiple values are represented as JSON arrays. Parameters that have no values MUST be omitted from the response.</t>

<t>An error response uses the applicable HTTP status code value.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example response:</t>

<figure><sourcecode type="http"><![CDATA[

</section>
<section anchor="pdp-metadata-data-endpoint-validation"><name>Policy Decision Point Metadata Validation</name>

<t>The <spanx style="verb">policy_decision_point</spanx> value returned MUST be identical to the Policy Decision Point identifier value into which the well-known URI string was inserted to create the URL used to retrieve the metadata.  If these values are not identical, the data contained in the response MUST NOT be used.</t>

<t>The recipient MUST validate that any signed metadata was signed by a key belonging to the issuer and that the signature is valid. If the signature does not validate or the issuer is not trusted, the recipient SHOULD treat this as an error condition.</t>

<section anchor="transport-https-json"><name>HTTPS JSON Binding</name>

<t>All API requests within this binding are made via an HTTPS <spanx style="verb">POST</spanx> request.</t>

<t>Requests MUST include a <spanx style="verb">Content-Type</spanx> header with the value <spanx style="verb">application/json</spanx>, and the request body for each endpoint MUST be a JSON object that conforms to the corresponding request structure, as defined in <xref target="_table-api-endpoints"/>.</t>

<t>A successful response is an HTTPS response with a status code of <spanx style="verb">200</spanx> and a <spanx style="verb">Content-Type</spanx> of <spanx style="verb">application/json</spanx>. Its body is a JSON object that conforms to the corresponding response structure, as defined in <xref target="_table-api-endpoints"/>.</t>

<t>The request URL MUST be the value of the corresponding endpoint parameter, as defined in <xref target="_table-api-endpoints"/>, if it is provided in the Policy Decision Point metadata (<xref target="pdp-metadata-data-endpoint"/>). If the parameter is not provided, the URL SHOULD be formed by appending the default path, as defined in <xref target="_table-api-endpoints"/>, to the PDP's base URL (which is the <spanx style="verb">policy_decision_point</spanx> value from the Policy Decision Point metadata, if available.</t>

<section anchor="error-responses"><name>Error Responses</name>
<t>The following error responses are common to all methods of the Authorization API. The error response is indicated by an HTTPS status code (<xref section="15" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9110"/>) that indicates error.</t>

<t>The following errors are indicated by the status codes defined below:</t>

<texttable title="HTTPS Error status codes" anchor="_table-error-status-codes">

</texttable>

<t>Note: HTTPS errors are returned by the PDP to indicate an error condition relating to the request or its processing; they are unrelated to the outcome of an authorization decision and are distinct from it. A successful request that results in a "deny" is indicated by a 200 OK status code with a { "decision": false } payload.</t>

<t>To make this concrete:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>a <spanx style="verb">401</spanx> HTTPS status code indicates that the PEP did not properly authenticate to the PDP - for example, by omitting a required <spanx style="verb">Authorization</spanx> header, or using an invalid access token.</t>
  <t>the PDP indicates to the PEP that the authorization request is denied by sending a response with a <spanx style="verb">200</spanx> HTTPS status code, along with a payload of <spanx style="verb">{ "decision": false }</spanx>.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="request-identification"><name>Request Identification</name>
<t>All requests to the API MAY have request identifiers to uniquely identify them. The PEP is responsible for generating the request identifier. If present, it is RECOMMENDED to use the HTTPS Header <spanx style="verb">X-Request-ID</spanx> as the request identifier. The value of this header is an arbitrary string. The following non-normative example describes this header:</t>

<figure title="Example HTTPS request with a Request Id Header" anchor="request-id-example"><sourcecode type="http"><![CDATA[
POST /access/v1/evaluation HTTP/1.1

X-Request-ID: bfe9eb29-ab87-4ca3-be83-a1d5d8305716
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<t>When an Authorization API request contains a request identifier the PDP MUST include a request identifier in the response. It is RECOMMENDED to specify the request identifier using the HTTPS Response header <spanx style="verb">X-Request-ID</spanx>. If the PEP specified a request identifier in the request, the PDP MUST include the same identifier in the response to that request.</t>

<section anchor="Security"><name>Security Considerations</name>

<section anchor="security-integrity-confidentiality"><name>Communication Integrity and Confidentiality</name>

<t>In the ABAC architecture, the PEP-PDP connection is the most sensitive one and needs to be secured to guarantee:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Integrity</t>
  <t>Confidentiality</t>
</list></t>

<t>As a result, the connection between the PEP and the PDP MUST be secured using the most adequate means given the choice of transport (e.g. TLS for HTTP REST).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-confidentiality-authn"><name>Policy Confidentiality and Sender Authentication</name>

<t>Additionally, the PDP SHOULD authenticate the calling PEP. There are several ways authentication can be established. These ways are out of scope of this specification. They MAY include:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Mutual TLS</t>
  <t>OAuth-based authentication</t>
  <t>API key</t>
</list></t>

<t>The choice and strength of either mechanism is not in scope.</t>

<t>Authenticating the PEP allows the PDP to avoid common attacks (such as DoS - see below) and/or reveal its internal policies. A malicious actor could craft a large number of requests to try and understand what policies the PDP is configured with. Requesting a PEP be authenticated mitigates that risk.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-sender-authentn-fail"><name>Sender Authentication Failure</name>

<t>If the protected resource request does not include the proper authentication credentials, or does not have a valid authentication scheme proof that enables access to the protected resource, the resource server MUST respond with a 401 HTTP status code and SHOULD include the HTTP "WWW-Authenticate" response header field; it MAY include it in response to other conditions as well. The "WWW-Authenticate" header field uses the framework defined by HTTP/1.1 <xref target="RFC2617"/> and indicates the expected authentication scheme as well as the realm that has authority for it.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example response:</t>

<t><spanx style="verb">http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="https://as.example.com"
</spanx></t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-trust"><name>Trust</name>

<t>In ABAC, there are occasionally conversations around the trust between PEP and PDP: how can the PDP trust that the PEP is sending the correct values? The architecture of this model assumes the PDP must trust the PEP, as the PEP is ultimately responsible for enforcing the decision the PDP produces.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-json"><name>JSON Payload Considerations</name>

<t>To ensure the unambiguous interpretation of JSON payloads, implementations SHOULD process and generate JSON payloads in a manner consistent with the I-JSON profile (<xref target="RFC7493"/>). In particular, implementations SHOULD ensure that:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>JSON text is encoded as UTF-8, and strings do not contain invalid Unicode sequences such as unpaired surrogates (<xref section="2.1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC7493"/>).</t>
  <t>Numeric values do not exceed the magnitude or precision supported by IEEE 754 double-precision (<xref section="2.2" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC7493"/>).</t>
  <t>Member names within a JSON object are unique after processing escape characters (<xref section="2.3" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC7493"/>).</t>
</list></t>

<t>To avoid ambiguity between a property that is absent and one that is present with a null value, properties with a value of null SHOULD be omitted from JSON objects.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-authorization-response-integrity"><name>Authorization Response Integrity</name>

<t>The PDP MAY choose to sign its authorization response, ensuring the PEP can verify the integrity of the data it receives. This practice is valuable for maintaining trust in the authorization process.</t>

<t>The PEP can ensure that the authorization response is not tampered with by verifying the signature of the authorization decision if it is signed. It ensures response accuracy and completeness.</t>

<t>TLS effectively protects data in transit for a direct, point-to-point connection but does not guarantee data integrity for the full connection path between the PEP and the PDP if there are intermediaries, such as proxies or gateways.</t>

<t>Digital signatures offer important advantages in this context. They provide non-repudiation, allowing verification that the response genuinely originated from the PDP. Moreover, digital signatures ensure the integrity of the authorization response, confirming that its contents have not been altered in transit.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-avail-dos"><name>Availability &amp; Denial of Service</name>

<t>The PDP SHOULD apply reasonable protections to avoid common attacks tied to request payload size, the number of requests, invalid JSON, nested JSON attacks, or memory consumption. Rate limiting is one such way to address such issues.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-metadata-sig"><name>Differences between Unsigned and Signed Metadata</name>

<t>Unsigned metadata is integrity protected by use of TLS at the site where it is hosted. This means that its security is dependent upon the Internet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) <xref target="RFC9525"/>. Signed metadata is additionally integrity protected by the JWS signature applied by the issuer, which is not dependent upon the Internet PKI.
When using unsigned metadata, the party issuing the metadata is the PDP itself. Whereas, when using signed metadata, the party issuing the metadata is represented by the <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> (issuer) claim in the signed metadata. When using signed metadata, applications can make trust decisions based on the issuer that performed the signing -- information that is not available when using unsigned metadata. How these trust decisions are made is out of scope for this specification.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-metadata-caching"><name>Metadata Caching</name>

<t>Policy Decision Point metadata is retrieved using an HTTP GET request, as specified in <xref target="pdp-metadata-access-request"/>. Normal HTTP caching behaviors apply, meaning that the GET may retrieve a cached copy of the content, rather than the latest copy. Implementations should utilize HTTP caching directives such as Cache-Control with max-age, as defined in <xref target="RFC7234"/>, to enable caching of retrieved metadata for appropriate time periods.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="iana"><name>IANA Considerations</name>

<t>This specification requests IANA to take four actions: the creation of a new protocol registry group named 'AuthZEN', the establishment of two new registries within this group ('AuthZEN Policy Decision Point Metadata' and 'AuthZEN Policy Decision Point Capabilities'), the registration of a new Well-Known URI ('authzen-configuration'), and the registration of a new URN sub-namespace ('authzen').</t>

<t>The following registration procedure is used for the registries established by this specification.</t>

<t>Values are registered on a Specification Required <xref target="RFC8126"/> basis after a two-week review period on the openid-specs-authzen@lists.openid.net mailing list, following review and approval by one or more Designated Experts. However, to allow for the allocation of values prior to publication of the final version of a specification, the Designated Experts may approve registration once they are satisfied that the specification will be completed and published. However, if the specification is not completed and published in a timely manner, as determined by the Designated Experts, the Designated Experts may request that IANA withdraw the registration.</t>

<t>Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review should use an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register AuthZEN Policy Decision Point Metadata: example").</t>

<t>Within the review period, the Designated Experts will either approve or deny the registration request, communicating this decision to the review list and IANA. Denials should include an explanation and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful. The IANA escalation process is followed when the Designated Experts are not responsive within 14 days.</t>

<t>Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts includes determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing functionality, determining whether it is likely to be of general applicability or whether it is useful only for a single application, and whether the registration makes sense.</t>

<t>IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated Experts and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing list.</t>

<t>It is suggested that multiple Designated Experts be appointed who are able to represent the perspectives of different applications using this specification, in order to enable broadly-informed review of registration decisions. In cases where a registration decision could be perceived as creating a conflict of interest for a particular Expert, that Expert should defer to the judgment of the other Experts.</t>

<t>The reason for the use of the mailing list is to enable public review of registration requests, enabling both Designated Experts and other interested parties to provide feedback on proposed registrations. The reason to allow the Designated Experts to allocate values prior to publication as a final specification is to enable giving authors of specifications proposing registrations the benefit of review by the Designated Experts before the specification is completely done, so that if problems are identified, the authors can iterate and fix them before publication of the final specification.</t>

<section anchor="iana-pdp-metadata-registry"><name>AuthZEN Policy Decision Point Metadata Registry</name>

<t>This specification asks IANA to establish the "AuthZEN Policy Decision Point Metadata" registry under the registry group "AuthZEN Parameters". The registry records the Policy Decision Point metadata parameter and a reference to the specification that defines it.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants to identify various protocol parameters. To ensure that the values in these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their allocations are often coordinated by a central record keeper. For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).</t>
      <t>To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed. This document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the provided guidance for the IANA Considerations is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry.</t>
      <t>This is the third edition of this document; it obsoletes RFC 5226.</t>
