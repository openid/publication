    <note title="Introduction">
      <t>Fintech is an area of future economic growth around the world and Fintech organizations need to improve the security of their operations and protect customer data. For example, it is a decades-old common practice of aggregation services to use screen scraping as a method to capture data and translate it to another service, such as usernames and passwords. This practice creates security gaps which require financial institutions to allow what ppears to be an automated attack against their applications and to maintain a whitelist of aggregators. A new draft standard, proposed by this workgroup would instead utilize an API model with structured data and a token model, such as OAuth [RFC6749, RFC6750].</t>
      <t>The Financial API aims to provide specific implementation guidelines for financial services to adopt for use cases of online banking by developing a REST/JSON data model protected by specified OAuth profile that is secure.</t>
      <t>This document is Part 2 of a set of 5 documents that specifies the Financial API and it provides a profile of OAuth that is suitable to be used in Write access to financial data (also known as transaction access). This document specifies the controls against attacks such as: authorization request tampering, authorization response tampering including code injection, state injection, and token request phishing. Additional details are available in the security considerations section.</t>

These APIs are protected by the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework that consists of [RFC6749], [RFC6750], [RFC7636], and other specifications.  </t><t>There are different levels of risks associated with access to these APIs. Read and Write access has a higher financial risk than Read-Only access. As such, the security profiles of the Authorization Framework protecting these APIs are also different.  </t><t>This profile describes security provisions for the server and client that are appropriate for Read and Write access by defining the measures to mitigate: * attacks that leverage the weak binding of endpoints in [RFC6749] (e.g. malicious endpoint attacks, IdP mix-up attacks), * attacks that modify authorization requests and responses unprotected in [RFC6749] by leveraging OpenID Connect's Hybrid Flow that returns an ID Token in the authorization response.  </t><t>While the name ID Token suggests that it is something that provides the identity of the resource owner (subject), it is not necessarily so. While it does identify the authorization server by including the issuer identifier, it is perfectly fine to have ephemeral subject identifier. In this case, the ID Token acts as a detached signature of the issuer to the authorization response and it was an explicit design decision of OpenID Connect Core to make the ID Token act as a detached signature.  </t><t>This document leverages this fact and protects the authorization response by including the hash of all of the unprotected response parameters, e.g. <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">code</spanx> and <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">state</spanx>.  </t><t>While the hash of the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">code</spanx> is defined in [OIDC], the hash of the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">state</spanx> is not defined.  Thus this document defines it as follows.  </t><t>** s_hash ** </t><t>State hash value. Its value is the base64url encoding of the left-most half of the hash of the octets of the ASCII representation of the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">state</spanx> value, where the hash algorithm used is the hash algorithm used in the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">alg</spanx> Header Parameter of the ID Token's JOSE Header. For instance, if the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">alg</spanx> is <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">HS512</spanx>, hash the state value with SHA-512, then take the left-most 256 bits and base64url encode them. The <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">s_hash</spanx> value is a case sensitive string.  </t></section><section title="Read and Write API Security Provisions" anchor="read-and-write-api-security-provisions" toc="default"><section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction-1" toc="default"><t>Read and Write access carries higher financial risk;

There is no notion of authorization server identifier (issuer identifier) and it is not indicated in the authorization response unless the client uses different redirection URI per authorization server. While it is assumed in the OAuth model, it is not explicitly spelled out and thus many clients use the same redirection URI for different authorization servers exposing an attack surface.  Several attacks have been identified and threats explained in more details in [RFC6819] in more detail.  </t></section><section title="Client Credential and Authorization Code Phishing at Token Endpoint" anchor="client-credential-and-authorization-code-phishing-at-token-endpoint" toc="default"><t>In this attack, the client developer is social engineered into believing that the token endpoint has changed to the URL that is controlled by the attacker. As the result, the client sends the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">code</spanx> and the client secret to the attacker, which will be replayed subsequently.  </t><t>When the FAPI client uses [MTLS] or [OAUTB], the authorization code is bound to the TLS channel, any phished client credentials and authorization codes submitted to the token endpoint cannot be used since the authorization code is bound to a particular TLS channel.  </t></section><section title="Identity Provider (IdP) Mix-up Attack" anchor="identity-provider-idp-mix-up-attack" toc="default"><t>In this attack, the client has registered multiple IdPs and one of them is a rogue IdP that returns the same <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">client_id</spanx> that belongs to one of the honest IdPs. When a user clicks on a malicious link or visits a compromised site, an authorization request is sent to the rogue IdP. The rogue IdP then redirects the client to the honest IdP that has the same <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">client_id</spanx>. If the user is already logged on at the honest IdP, then the authentication may be skipped and a code is generated and returned to the client.  Since the client was interacting with the rogue IdP, the code is sent to the rogue IdP's token endpoint. At the point, the attacker has a valid code that can be exchanged for an Access Token at the honest IdP.  </t><t>This is mitigated by the use of OpenID Connect Hybrid Flow in which the honest IdP's issuer identifier is included as the value of <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">iss</spanx>. The client then sends the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">code</spanx> to the token endpoint that is associated with the issuer identifier thus it will not get to the attacker.  </t></section><section title="Request Object Endpoint Phishing Resistance" anchor="request-object-endpoint-phishing-resistance" toc="default"><t>An attacker can use social engineering to have the administrator of the client set the request object endpoint to a URL under the attacker's control. In this case, sensitive information included in the request object will be revealed to the attacker. To prevent this, the authorization server should communicate to the client developer the proper change process repeatedly to help client developers to be less susceptible to such social engineering.  </t></section><section title="Access Token Phishing" anchor="access-token-phishing" toc="default"><t>When the FAPI client uses [MTLS] or [OAUTB], the access token is bound to the TLS channel, it is access token phishing resistant as the phished access tokens cannot be used.  </t></section></section><section title="Attacks that Modify Authorization Requests and Responses" anchor="attacks-that-modify-authorization-requests-and-responses" toc="default"><section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction-6" toc="default"><t>In [RFC6749] the authorization request and responses are not integrity protected. Thus, an attacker can modify them.  </t></section><section title="Authorization Request Parameter Injection Attack" anchor="authorization-request-parameter-injection-attack" toc="default"><t>In [RFC6749], the authorization request is sent as query parameter. Although [RFC6749] mandates the user of TLS, the TLS is terminated in the browser and thus not protected within the browser; as a result an attacker can tamper the authorization request and insert any parameter values.  </t><t>The use of a <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">request</spanx> object or <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">request_uri</spanx> in the authorization request will prevent tampering with the request parameters.  </t><t><eref target="https://www.nds.rub.de/media/ei/veroeffentlichungen/2017/01/30/oidc-security.pdf">SoK: Single Sign-On Security &#8211; An Evaluation of OpenID Connect</eref> is an example of this kind of attack.  </t></section><section title="Authorization Response Parameter Injection Attack" anchor="authorization-response-parameter-injection-attack" toc="default"><t>This attack occurs when the victim and attacker use the same relying party client. The attacker is somehow able to capture the authorization code and state from the victim's authorization response and uses them in his own authorization response.  </t><t>This can be mitigated by using OpenID Connect Hybrid Flow where the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">c_hash</spanx>, <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">at_hash</spanx>, and <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">s_hash</spanx> can be used to verify the validity of the authorization code, access token, and state parameters. The server can verify that the state is the same as what was stored in the browser session at the time of the authorization request.  </t></section></section><section title="TLS Considerations" anchor="tls-considerations" toc="default"><t>As confidential information is being exchanged, all interactions shall be encrypted with TLS (HTTPS).  </t><t>The recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security in BCP195 shall be followed, with the following additional requirements: </t><t><list style="numbers"><t>Only the following 4 cipher suites shall be permitted: <list style="symbols"><t><spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</spanx> </t><t><spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</spanx> </t><t><spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</spanx> </t><t><spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</spanx> </t></list> </t><t>TLS version 1.2 or later shall be used for all communications.  </t><t>A TLS server certificate check shall be performed, as per [RFC6125].  </t></list></t></section><section title="JWS Algorithm Considerations" anchor="jws-algorithm-considerations" toc="default"><t>JWS signatures shall use the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">PS256</spanx> or <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">ES256</spanx> algorithms for signing.  </t></section></section><section title="Privacy Considerations" anchor="privacy-considerations" toc="default"><t><list style="symbols"><t>If the client is to be used by a single user, the client certificate will provide the means for the websites that belong to different administrative domains to collude and correlate the user's access.
