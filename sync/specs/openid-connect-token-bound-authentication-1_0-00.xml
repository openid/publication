      <t>OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
      protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based

    <section anchor="Representation" title="OpenID Connect Token Binding Representation">
      <t>
	Section 3 (Federation Use Cases) of 
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-tokbind-https">Token Binding over HTTP</xref>
	outlines how Token Binding is used with federation protocols in the abstract.
	This section defines the concrete data structures for using Token Binding
	with OpenID Connect.
      </t>
      <t>
	Section 3.2 of
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-tokbind-https">Token Binding over HTTP</xref>
	suggests placing the public key of the Token Binding
	used to communicate with the Relying Party in the ID Token.
	A representation of this key is communicated to the OpenID Provider
	in its Referred Token Binding ID.
	This specification utilizes a variant of this approach in which
	a cryptographic hash of the Token Binding ID
	using the SHA-256 hash function <xref target="SHS"/>
	is instead added to the ID Token.
	This has the benefit of significantly reducing the size of the information
	added to the ID Token from what it would otherwise have been were the
	Token Binding ID to be included directly - particularly in the RSA key case.
      </t>
      <t>
	The recipient MUST verify that the SHA-256 hash
	of the Provided Token Binding ID
	matches the SHA-256 hash contained in the ID Token.
      </t>
      <t>
	This specification defines the new JWT Confirmation Method
	<xref target="RFC7800">RFC 7800</xref>
	member <spanx style="verb">tbh</spanx> (token binding hash) 
	to represent the SHA-256 hash of a Token Binding ID
	in an ID Token.
	The value of the <spanx style="verb">tbh</spanx> member is the
	base64url encoding of the SHA-256 hash of the Token Binding ID.
      </t>
      <t>
	The following example demonstrates the JWT Claims Set of an ID Token
	containing the base64url encoding of the SHA-256 hash of a Token Binding ID
	as the value of the <spanx style="verb">tbh</spanx> (token binding hash)
	element in the <spanx style="verb">cnf</spanx> (confirmation) claim:

    <section anchor="Actions" title="OpenID Connect Token Binding Actions">
      <t>
	This specification maps the abstract Token Binding actions specified in
	Section 3 (Federation Use Cases) of 
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-tokbind-https">Token Binding over HTTP</xref>
	into concrete actions added to the authentication steps specified in
	Section 3 (Authentication) of
	<xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</xref>.
	Mapping the terminologies used in the two specifications,
	the Relying Party is the Token Consumer and
	the OpenID Provider is the Token Provider.
      </t>
      <t>
	For OpenID Connect flows returning the ID Token directly from the Authorization Endpoint --
	the Implicit Flow defined in Section 3.2 of
	<xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</xref>
	and the Hybrid Flow defined in Section 3.3 of OpenID Connect Core 1.0 when using the
	<spanx style="verb">code&nbsp;id_token</spanx> or
	<spanx style="verb">code&nbsp;id_token&nbsp;token</spanx> Response Types --
	the actions described in Section 3.5 of
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-tokbind-https">Token Binding over HTTP</xref>
	are performed as described.
	The one difference, as previously described, is that
	a cryptographic hash
	using the SHA-256 hash function <xref target="SHS"/>
	of the Token Binding ID is instead added to the ID Token,
	rather than the Token Binding ID itself.
      </t>
      <t>
	For OpenID Connect flows returning the ID Token from the Token Endpoint --
	the Authorization Code Flow defined in Section 3.1 of
	<xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</xref>
	and the Hybrid Flow defined in Section 3.3 of OpenID Connect Core 1.0 --
	an additional step is necessary beyond those in the previous case.
	That step is for the RP to record the Token Binding ID
	used when communicating between the User Agent and the RP,
	saving it for later use after the Token Response containing the ID Token
	returned from the Token Endpoint is received.
	This is needed because the ID Token will contain Token Binding information
	from the TLS connection between the User Agent and the Relying Party --
	not information from the TLS connection between the RP and the Token Endpoint.
	In this case, even though the ID Token is returned from the Token Endpoint,
	the Token Binding validation steps are performed using
	the saved Token Binding ID,
	rather than the Token Binding ID
	used when communicating with the Token Endpoint.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Phasing" title="Phasing in Token Binding and Preventing Downgrade Attacks">
      <t>
	Many OpenID Connect implementations will be deployed in situations in which
	not all participants support Token Binding.
	Any of combination of the Relying Party, the OpenID Provider,
	and the User Agent may not yet support Token Binding,
	in which case it will not work end-to-end.
      </t>
      <t>
	It is a context-dependent deployment choice whether to allow
	authentications to proceed in which Token Binding is not supported
	or whether to treat Token Binding failures at any step as fatal errors.
	In dynamic deployment environments in which End Users have choices
	of Relying Parties, the OpenID Providers, and/or User Agents,
	it is RECOMMENDED that authentications using one or more components
	that do not implement Token Binding be allowed to successfully proceed.
	This enables different components to be upgraded to supporting Token Binding
	at different times, providing a smooth transition path for
	phasing in Token Binding.
	However, when Token Binding has been performed,
	any Token Binding key mismatches MUST be treated as fatal errors.
      </t>
      <t>
	If all the participants in an OpenID Connect authentication
	support Token Binding and yet one or more of them does not use it,
	this is likely evidence of a downgrade attack.
	In this case, the authentication SHOULD be aborted with an error.
	For instance, if the RP knows that the OP and the User Agent both
	support Token Binding and yet the ID Token received does not contain
	Token Binding information, this is almost certainly a sign of an attack.
      </t>
      <t>
	The OP and RP can determine whether the other supports Token Binding
	using the metadata values defined in the next section.
	They can determine whether the User Agent supports Token Binding
	by whether it negotiated Token Binding for the TLS connection.

	It is largely the RP's responsibility to detect attempted man-in-the-middle attacks.

	When all parties support Token Binding and there is either a Token Binding mismatch
