    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines how an OpenID Authentication 2.0 Relying
      Party can migrate the user from OpenID 2.0 identifier to OpenID Connect
      Identifier by using an ID Token that includes the OpenID 2.0 verified
      claimed ID. In this specification, the method to request such an
      additional claim and the method for the verification of the resulting ID
      Token is specified.</t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>OpenID Authentication 2.0 is a popular authentication federation
      protocol through which the Relying Party can obtain the user&rsquo;s
      verified identifier from the OpenID Provider (OP) to which the user was
      authenticated. OpenID Connect is a new version of OpenID Authentication but the
      identifier format is different and thus Relying Parties need to migrate
      those user identifiers to continue serving these users.</t>

      <t>In this specification, a standard method for this kind of migration
      on a per-user basis is described.</t>

      <section anchor="rnc" title="Requirements Notation and Conventions">

        the term defined in OpenID Connect Core takes precedence.</t>

             title="Requesting the OpenID 2.0 Identifier and OpenID Connect Identifier Together">
      <t>To obtain the OpenID 2.0 Identifier, the RP sends a modified OpenID
      Connect Authentication Request by adding <spanx style="verb">openid2</spanx>
      as an additional scope value.</t>
      
      <t>NOTE: If the OP does not support the <spanx style="verb">openid2</spanx> scope, 
      it SHOULD ignore it, as specified in Section 3.1.2.1 of 
      <xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</xref>.</t>

      <t>If a pairwise pseudonymous identifier (PPID) was used to obtain the OpenID 2.0 Identifier,
      <spanx style="verb">openid.realm</spanx>
      has to be sent to the OP with the request. For this purpose, a new
      authentication request parameter <spanx style="verb">openid2_realm</spanx>
      is defined.</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="openid2_realm"><vspace />REQUIRED. The <spanx

        </list>If the authority section of Authorization Endpoint URI is
      different from the authority section of the OpenID 2.0 OP&rsquo;s OP
      Endpoint URL, the client MUST issue a GET request to the OpenID 2.0
      Identifier obtained through the ID Token, i.e., the value of
      <spanx style="verb">openid2_id</spanx>, with
      an Accept header set to <spanx style="verb">application/json</spanx>
      to obtain the value of 
      <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> claim in it. 
      The value of the <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> claim 
      obtained this way and the value of 
      the <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> 
      claim in the ID Token MUST exactly match.
      </t>

      <t>NOTE: This is similar to <xref target="Yadis">Yadis</xref>.
      In the Yadis case, it is using an Accept header with
      its value set to <spanx style="verb">application/xml+xrds.</spanx></t>
      
      <t>The following is a non-normative example of an

      <t>A malicious OP may try to impersonate the user by returning the
      OpenID 2.0 Identifier that it is not authoritative for. Therefore,
      verifying that the Connect OP is indeed authoritative for the OpenID 2.0
      Identifier is imperative. To verify that the Connect OP is 
      authoritative for the OpenID 2.0 Identifier, 
	  the RP MUST verify that one of the following
      verification rules hold:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>If the RP a priori knows that the authority hosted only one
          OpenID 2.0 OP and OpenID Connect OP each, the authority section of
          Authorization Endpoint URI is the same as the authority section of
          the OpenID 2.0 OP&rsquo;s OP Endpoint URL.</t>

          <t>If they are not (or when a higher confidence is sought), RP MUST
          make a GET call to the obtained verified claimed ID with an Accept
          header set to <spanx style="verb">application/json</spanx>. 
          The server SHOULD return a JSON with <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> 
          as its top level member. 
          The value of this member MUST exactly match the 
          <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> 
          in the ID Token. 
          </t>

          <xref target="XRI_Syntax_2.0">XRI</xref>.  
          In this case, the RP needs to construct the 
          verification URI by concatenating 
          <spanx style="verb">https://xri.net/</spanx>,
          the value of the
          <spanx style="verb">openid2_id</spanx> claim, and 
          <spanx style="verb">/(+openid_iss)</spanx>. 
          Requesting the resulting URI with GET will 
          result in a series of HTTP 302 redirects. 
          The RP MUST follow the redirects until 
          HTTP status code <spanx style="verb">200 OK</spanx> 
          comes back. The URI that resulted in 
          <spanx style="verb">200 OK</spanx> is the 
          authoritative issuer for the XRI. 
          This URI MUST exactly match the 
          <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> 
          in the ID Token except for the potential trailing 
          slash (<spanx style="verb">/</spanx>) character. 
          </t>
        </list>If all three fail, the verification has failed and the RP MUST NOT accept the
      OpenID 2.0 Identifier.</t>

    <t>NOTE: XRI users may need to configure the forwarding service 
    and define (+openid_iss) themselves.

      However, there are not many OpenID 2.0 Providers that use different values for

      Yahoo! and Yahoo! Japan seem to be the only large scale providers that fall under this

        <t>While there is no technical control in this standard as to the
        secondary use is concerned, RP is strongly advised to announce its
        policy against secondary use in its privacy policy. Secondary use
        usually is associated with privacy impact, so its legitimacy should be

      <section anchor="Disclosure" title="Disclosure">
        <t>Since the channel is encrypted, this risk is low. If the channel
        was vulnerable, then user identifiers and other attributes will be

    <section anchor="GoogleDifference" title="Differences from Google&rsquo;s Migration Guide as of June 3, 2014 ">
      <t>In this appendix, the differences between this spec and
      Google&rsquo;s migration guide as of June 3, 2014 are explained. The
      differences are categorized in accordance with the section number of
      this specification. Google's migration guide is available at <eref 
      target="https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OpenID#openid-connect">
      Migrating to OAuth 2.0 login (OpenID Connect)
      </eref>.
      </t>

      <t><xref target="RequestOpenid2Id" format="counter" />. 
      <xref target="RequestOpenid2Id" format="title" /></t>

      <t>Google uses <spanx style="verb">openid.realm</spanx> instead of <spanx style="verb">openid2_realm</spanx>. Since
      OpenID Connect uses <spanx style="verb">param_name</spanx> style names instead of <spanx style="verb">param.name</spanx> style
      and the name <spanx style="verb">openid.realm</spanx> might mislead
      users into thinking that it is a Connect parameter proper, it has been changed to
      <spanx style="verb">openid2_realm</spanx>.</t>

      <t>Google uses the existence of the
      <spanx style="verb">openid.realm</spanx> parameter to switch the
      behavior at the Connect OP. The new scope value <spanx style="verb">openid2</spanx>
      has been introduced in this spec to make it more explicit and
      semantically consistent that it is asking for a resource.</t>

      <t><xref target="VerifyRP" format="counter" />. 
      <xref target="VerifyRP" format="title" /></t>

      <t>Google does not perform RP verification.</t>

      <t><xref target="ReturnOpenID2ID" format="counter" />. 
      <xref target="ReturnOpenID2ID" format="title" /></t>

      <t>Google uses the claim name <spanx style="verb">openid_id</spanx> instead of <spanx
      style="verb">openid2_id</spanx>. It was changed to <spanx style="verb">openid2_id</spanx>
      because <spanx style="verb">openid_id</spanx> may cause confusion among
      people that it is the Connect identifier. Since this spec allows
      providing <spanx style="verb">openid2_id</spanx> even after the OpenID
      2.0 OP has been taken down, this claim may persists much longer than the
      OpenID 2.0 OP. Thus, the chance of confusion should be minimized. </t>

      <t>Google does not take care of <xref target="XRI_Syntax_2.0">XRI</xref>
      while this standard does.</t>

      <t><xref target="VerifyOPAuthority" format="counter" />. 
      <xref target="VerifyOPAuthority" format="title" /></t>

      <t>Google does not perform authority verification.</t>
