<abstract>
<t>This specification defines an extension of OpenID Connect that registers new JWT claims about end-users. This extension defines new claims relating to the identity of a natural person that were originally defined within earlier drafts of OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance. The work and the preceding drafts are the work of the eKYC and Identity Assurance working group of the OpenID Foundation.</t>
</abstract>

<note><name>Foreword</name>
<t>The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) promotes, protects and nurtures the OpenID community and technologies. As a non-profit international standardizing body, it is comprised by over 160 participating entities (workgroup participant). The work of preparing implementer drafts and final international standards is carried out through OIDF workgroups in accordance with the OpenID Process. Participants interested in a subject for which a workgroup has been established have the right to be represented in that workgroup. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with OIDF, also take part in the work. OIDF collaborates closely with other standardizing bodies in the related fields.</t>
<t>Final drafts adopted by the Workgroup through consensus are circulated publicly for the public review for 60 days and for the OIDF members for voting. Publication as an OIDF Standard requires approval by at least 50% of the members casting a vote. There is a possibility that some of the elements of this document may be subject to patent rights. OIDF shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.</t>
</note>

<note><name>Introduction</name>
<t>This specification defines additional JWT claims about the natural person.  The claims defined can be used in various contexts including an ID Token.</t>
</note>

<note><name>Warning</name>
<t>This document is not an OIDF International Standard. It is distributed for
review and comment. It is subject to change without notice and may not be
referred to as an International Standard.
Recipients of this draft are invited to submit, with their comments,
notification of any relevant patent rights of which they are aware and to
provide supporting documentation.</t>
</note>

<note><name>Notational conventions</name>
<t>The keywords &quot;shall&quot;, &quot;shall not&quot;, &quot;should&quot;, &quot;should not&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, and &quot;can&quot; in
this document are to be interpreted as described in ISO Directive Part 2
<xref target="ISODIR2"></xref>. These keywords are not used as dictionary terms such that any
occurrence of them shall be interpreted as keywords and are not to be
interpreted with their natural language meanings.</t>
