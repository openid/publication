1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow
   [CIBA.Core] [CIBA Core] is an authentication flow like OpenID Connect
   in which a Relying Party, that can obtain a valid identifier for the
   user they want to authenticate, will be able to initiate an
   interaction flow to authenticate their users without having end-user
   interaction from the consumption device.  The flow involves direct
   communication from the Client to the OpenID Provider without redirect
   through the user's browser (consumption device).

   This specification is a MODRNA profile of the OpenID Connect Client
   Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow [CIBA.Core] [CIBA.Core] to
   be used when requesting authentication from Mobile Network Operators
   (MNOs) and includes guidance specific to that context.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are
   to be taken literally.  When using these values in protocol messages,
   the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.

2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "OpenID Provider (OP)" and "Relying
   Party (RP)" as defined by OpenID Connect Core [OpenID.Core]
   [OpenID.Core].  Furthermore, it uses the term "Client" as defined by
   OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].  OAuth 2.0 Authorization Servers implementing
   OpenID Connect and CIBA are also referred to as OpenID Providers
   (OPs).  OAuth 2.0 Clients using OpenID Connect and CIBA are also
   referred to as Relying Parties (RPs).  This specification also uses
   the following terms:

   Mobile Network Operator (MNO)  A provider of wireless communication
      services that owns or controls the wireless network elements
      necessary to sell and deliver services to an end user.

   Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number (MSISDN)  A
      telephone number uniquely identifying a subscription in a mobile
      network.

   Consumption Device (CD)  The Consumption Device is the device that
      helps the user consume the service.  In the CIBA use case, the
      user is not necessarily in control of the CD.  For example, the CD

      may be in the control of an RP agent (e.g. at a bank teller) or
      may be an RP controlled device (e.g. a petrol pump).

   Authentication Device (AD)  The device on which the user will
      authenticate and authorize the request, often a smartphone.

3.  Overview

   Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) enables a Client
   to initiate the authentication of an end-user by means of out-of-band
   mechanisms.  The OpenID Connect Client Initiated Backchannel
   Authentication Flow [CIBA.Core] [CIBA Core] defines three ways to
   deliver the tokens and step 3 will cover the requirements for this
   profile.

   1.  The Client shall make an "HTTP POST" request to the Backchannel
       Authentication Endpoint to ask for end-user authentication.

   2.  The OP will respond immediately with a unique identifier that
       identifies that authentication while it tries to authenticate the
       user in the background.

   3.  The Client will receive the ID Token, Access Token and optionally
       Refresh Token by means of either the Poll or Push modes.  This
       choice MUST be established by the Client at registration time.

       Poll Mode  When configured in Poll mode, the Client will poll the
          token endpoint to get a response with the tokens.

       Push Mode  When configured in Push mode, the OP will send a
          request with the tokens to a callback URI previously
          registered by the Client.

3.1.  Examples of Use Cases

   The following use cases are non-normative examples to illustrate the
   usage of this specification.

   1.  A call center agent wants to authenticate a caller.  Using
       additional scopes like e.g. "profile" or "phone" the call center
       agent would get access to claims about the user like
       "phone_number" and "phone_number_verified".

   2.  An IDP wants to offer the ability for its relying parties to
       request "step-up" authorisation via a decoupled device

4.  Authentication Request

   The Authentication Request has the following differences from the
   OpenID Connect Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow
   [CIBA.Core] [CIBA Core]:

   acr_values  REQUIRED.  This value is required as defined in OpenID
      Connect MODRNA Authentication Profile [MODRNA.Authentication]
      [MODRNA.Authentication].

   Note: While the structure of a "login_hint" is undefined, in a mobile
   context a login_hint is likely to contain a MSISDN.

   Note: An ecosystem can protect the pricacy of a user's MSISDN and
   other personally identifiable information through the use of a
   discovery service.  The discovery service can return an encrypted
   "login_hint_token" for use in a CIBA flow.

5.  Security Considerations

   While this profile suports CIBA push mode, implementers should only
   implement that mode if the constraints of an environment require it,
   e.g. high latency environments.  Poll mode is preferred as this
   method of token delivery is the same as other OAuth 2.0 based flows,
   and therefore more likely to have had appropriate security review.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   Using MODRNA CIBA Profile it is possible for the Client to
   authenticate a user without knowing e.g. the MSISDN of the user.
   Users might be reluctant to provide their MSISDN to Clients because
   they fear misuse through automated calls or their number being
   leaked.  The login hint token can be encrypted in order to protect
   the user's MSISDN from being revealed to the Client unintentionally.

   The section Example Flow shows an example to illustrate the usage of
   MODRNA CIBA Profile specification to authenticate a user with a SIM
   Applet Authenticator.

Appendix A.  Example Flow

   This is a non-normative example where a challenge authentication is
   launched by the OP to an applet that is running in the end-user
   device's SIM.  Such applet implements an authenticator that validates
   a Pin Code entered by the end-user.

   This authenticator would be implemented through the so-called MSSP
   (Mobile Signature Subscriber Provider) Server.  When the Backchannel
   Authentication Endpoint receives the request to authenticate the user
   and once it knows the user's MSISDN, it makes a call to the MSSP
   Server which builds a binary Class 2 SMS that is sent to the SIM card
   of the user where the applet is located.

   This Class 2 SMS is not really sent directly from the MSSP but
   through the OTA (Over the air) platform which in turn signs and
   encrypts the message using a pair of keys (kyc, kyd) unique per each
   SIM Card.

                           MODRNA CIBA Profile                April 2020


   Once the message reaches the SIM Card, it is decrypted by the
   CardManager and the signature is verified (thanks to the same pair of
   keys: kyc, kyd).  If everything is ok, the CardManager gives the
   message to the applet that checks the signature (the another one made
   by the MSSP) and displays the challenge through a popup using the
   mobile phone native interface) and the user is prompted to enter a
   Pin Code that is validated locally.  If the Pin Code is correct, the
   applet builds an OK response and signs it with the same key used by
   the MSSP to sign the request, this response is sent as a Class 3
   message to the MSSP that checks the signature, and builds the
   id_token and the access_token to be returned to the Client.
