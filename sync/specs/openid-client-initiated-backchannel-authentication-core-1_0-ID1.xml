      <t>
        OpenID Connect Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow is an authentication
        flow like OpenID Connect. However, unlike OpenID Connect, there is direct Relying Party to OpenID
        Provider communication without redirects through the user's browser.
        This specification allows a Relying Party that knows the user's identifier to obtain tokens from the
        OpenID Provider. The user consent is given at the user's Authentication Device mediated by the OpenID Provider.
      </t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        <xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect</xref> allows Relying Parties (RP) to authenticate their users for clients of all types, including 
        browser-based JavaScript and native mobile apps, to launch sign-in flows and receive verifiable 
        assertions about the identity of signed-in users.
      </t>
      <t>
        In all of these flows initiated by the RP, the end-user interaction from the consumption device is 
        required and, they are based on HTTP redirection mechanisms. However, some use cases not covered by
        these flows have been raised, where the RP needs to be the initiator of the user authentication flow and end-user interaction
        from the consumption device is not needed.
      </t>
      <t>
        Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) is a new authentication flow
        in which RPs, that can obtain a valid identifier for the user they want to authenticate, will be able to
        initiate an interaction flow to authenticate their users without having end-user interaction
        from the consumption device. The flow involves direct communication from the Client to the OpenID Provider 
        without redirect through the user's browser (consumption device).
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification does not change the semantics of the OpenID Connect Authentication flow.
        It introduces a new endpoint to which the authentication request is posted.
        It introduces a new asynchronous method for authentication result notification or delivery.
        It does not introduce new scope values nor does it change the semantics of standard OpenID Connect parameters.
      </t>
      <t>
        As the user does not provide authentication credentials directly to the consumption device, supporting this 
        flow requires the to OP have some mechanism of initiating user authentication out-of-band from the interaction 
        with the consumption device.

            <t hangText="Poll and Ping Modes with Pairwise Identifiers">
              In order to use the Poll or Ping mode with Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifiers (PPIDs),
              the Client needs to register a URI that is of its ownership and use it during the authentication process in a way that demonstrates 
              that the URI belongs to it, which allows the OP to consider the host component of that URI as the Sector Identifier for the pairwise 
              identifier calculation per <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#PairwiseAlg">Section 8.1 of OpenID 
              Connect Core</eref>.
            </t>
            <t>
              The only way that CIBA generates Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifiers in Ping and Poll modes is by providing a "jwks_uri" at the 
              registration phase when the "urn:openid:params:grant-type:ciba" grant type is registered. In that way 
              the OpenID Provider can use the host component of the "jwks_uri" as the Sector Identifier to generate the PPIDs for the Client. 
              So, when an OpenID Provider that supports PPIDs receives a dynamic registration request for a Client that indicates that it wishes 
              to use the Poll or Ping CIBA modes, it MUST check if a valid "jwks_uri" is set when the "subject_type" is "pairwise".

              If a "sector_identifier_uri" is explicitly provided, then the "jwks_uri" must be included in the list of URIs pointed to by 
              the "sector_identifier_uri".
            </t>            
            <t>
              But having registered a "jwks_uri" is not enough to use PPIDs, Client needs somehow to demonstrate that such "jwks_uri" belongs to it,
              which can be accomplished by proving possession of a private key corresponding to one of the public keys published at the "jwks_uri".
              Such proof can be demonstrated with signed authentication requests using the asymmetric keys provided by the "jwks_uri" or
              by authenticating to the OP using one of the following two mechanisms in conjunction with a key from its "jwks_uri":

        This specification allows the Client to get the authentication result in three ways: poll, ping or push.
      </t>
      <t>
        In the Poll mode, the authentication result is retrieved by the Client by polling the OP's token endpoint using the new grant type. 
      </t>
      <t>
        In the Ping mode, the OP will post the unique identifier of the authentication session to the Client, the
        Client will then retrieve the authentication result from the token endpoint using the new grant type.
      </t>

    <section title='Example Use Cases'>
        <t>The following use cases are non-normative examples to illustrate the usage of this specification.</t>
        <t>
        <list style="numbers">
        <t>A call center agent wants to authenticate a caller. 
        Using additional scopes like e.g. "profile" or "phone" the call center agent would get access to claims
        about the user like "phone_number" and "phone_number_verified".
        </t>
        <t>A bank teller wants to authenticate a customer in a bank branch - using CIBA for authentication in a face-to-face scenario.
        </t>
        <t>
          A user wants to use their smartphone to authorize a payment they are making at a point of sale terminal.

        </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="auth_backchannel_endpoint" title="Backchannel Authentication Endpoint">
      <t>
        The Backchannel Authentication Endpoint is used to initiate an out-of-band authentication of the end-user. This is done by sending an HTTP
        POST message directly from the Client to the OpenID Provider's Backchannel Authentication Endpoint, using 
        a request defined in the following subsections.
      </t>
      <t>
        Communication with the Backchannel Authentication Endpoint MUST utilize TLS. See Section 16.17 <xref target="OpenID.Core"/>
        for more information on using TLS.
      </t>

      <section anchor="auth_request" title="Authentication Request">
        <t>
          Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication defines an authentication request that is requested directly from
          the Client to the OpenID Provider without going through the user's browser. The Client MUST send an authentication 
          request to the OpenID Provider by building an "HTTP POST" request that will take to the OpenID Provider all the 
          information needed to authenticate the user without asking them for their identifier.      
        </t>
        <t>
          The Client MUST authenticate to the Backchannel Authentication Endpoint using the authentication method registered for its 
          client_id, such as the authentication methods from Section 9 of <xref target="OpenID.Core"/> or authentication methods
          defined by extension in other specifications.
        </t>
        <t>
          An authentication request is composed of the following parameters and MAY contain additional parameters defined by extension or profile:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="scope">
              REQUIRED.
              The scope of the access request as described by Section 3.3 of <xref target="RFC6749"/>.
              OpenID Connect implements authentication as an extension to OAuth 2.0 by including the
              <spanx style="verb">openid</spanx> scope value in the authorization requests. Consistent with that,
              CIBA authentication requests MUST therefore contain the <spanx style="verb">openid</spanx> scope value.
              The behavior when the <spanx style="verb">openid</spanx> scope value is not present is left unspecified by this document,
              thus allowing for the potential definition of the behavior in a non OpenID context, such as an OAuth authorization flow.
              Other scope values MAY be present, including but not limited to the
              <spanx style="verb">profile</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">email</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">address</spanx>
              and <spanx style="verb">phone</spanx> scope values from Section 5.4 of <xref target="OpenID.Core"/>.
            </t>
            <t hangText="client_notification_token">
              REQUIRED if the Client is registered to use Ping or Push modes. 
              It is a bearer token provided by the Client that will be used by the OpenID Provider to authenticate the callback request to the Client.
              The length of the token MUST NOT exceed 1024 characters and it MUST conform to the syntax for Bearer credentials as defined in Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC6750"/>.
              Clients MUST ensure that it contains sufficient entropy (a minimum of 128 bits while 160 bits is recommended) to make
              brute force guessing or forgery of a valid token computationally infeasible - the means of achieving this are implementation specific,
              with possible approaches including secure pseudorandom number generation or cryptographically secured self-contained tokens.
            </t>
            <t hangText="acr_values">
              OPTIONAL. Requested Authentication Context Class Reference values.
              Space-separated string that specifies the acr values that the OpenID Provider is being requested to use for
              processing this Authentication Request, with the values appearing in order of preference.
              The actual means of authenticating the end-user, however, are ultimately at the discretion of the OP and
              the Authentication Context Class satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the <spanx style="verb">acr</spanx> Claim Value of the ID Token.
              When the <spanx style="verb">acr_values</spanx> parameter is present in the authentication request, it is highly RECOMMENDED that the resulting ID Token
              contain an <spanx style="verb">acr</spanx> Claim.
            </t>

            <t hangText="login_hint_token">
              OPTIONAL.
              A token containing information identifying the end-user for whom authentication is being requested.
              The particular details and security requirements for the <spanx style="verb">login_hint_token</spanx> as well as how
              the end-user is identified by its content are deployment or profile specific.
            </t>

            <t hangText="id_token_hint">
              OPTIONAL.
              An ID Token previously issued to the Client by the OpenID Provider being passed back as a hint to identify
              the end-user for whom authentication is being requested.
              If the ID Token received by the Client from the OP was encrypted, to use it as an id_token_hint,
              the client MUST decrypt the encrypted ID Token to extract the signed ID Token contained in it.
            </t> 
            <t hangText="login_hint">
              OPTIONAL.
              A hint to the OpenID Provider regarding the end-user for whom authentication is being requested.
              The value may contain an email address, phone number, account number, subject identifier, username, etc., which
              identifies the end-user to the OP. The value may be directly collected from the user by the Client before
              requesting authentication at the OP, for example, but may also be obtained by other means.
            </t>
            <t hangText="binding_message">
              OPTIONAL.
              A human readable identifier or message intended to be displayed on both the consumption device and the authentication device
              to interlock them together for the transaction by way of a visual cue for the end-user. This interlocking message
              enables the end-user to ensure that the action taken on the authentication device is related to the
              request initiated by the consumption device.
              The value SHOULD contain something that enables the end-user to reliably discern that the transaction is related across the consumption device and the authentication device,
              such as a random value of reasonable entropy (e.g. a transactional approval code).
              Because the various devices involved may have limited display abilities and the message is intending for visual inspection by the end-user,
              the <spanx style="verb">binding_message</spanx> value
              SHOULD be relatively short and use a limited set of plain text characters.
              The <spanx style="verb">invalid_binding_message</spanx> defined in <xref target="auth_error_response"/> is used in the case
              that it is necessary to inform the Client that the provided <spanx style="verb">binding_message</spanx> is unacceptable.
            </t>
            <t hangText="user_code">
              OPTIONAL. A secret code, such as password or pin, known only to the user but verifiable by the OP. The code is used to authorize sending an authentication request to user's authentication device. 
              This parameter should only be present if client registration parameter <spanx style="verb">backchannel_user_code_parameter</spanx> indicates support for user code.
            </t>
            <t hangText="requested_expiry">
              OPTIONAL. A positive integer allowing the client to request the <spanx style="verb">expires_in</spanx> value for
              the <spanx style="verb">auth_req_id</spanx> the server will return.
              The server MAY use this value to influence the lifetime of the authentication request and is encouraged
              to do so where it will improve the user experience, for example by terminating the authentication when as it knows
              the client is no longer interested in the result.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          As in the CIBA flow the OP does not have an interaction with the end-user through the consumption device,
          it is REQUIRED that the Client provides one (and only one) of the hints specified above in the authentication request, that is "login_hint_token", 
          "id_token_hint" or "login_hint".
        </t>
        <t>
          An authentication request is made using the
          HTTP <spanx style='verb'>POST</spanx> method with the aforementioned
          parameters in the <spanx style='verb'>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</spanx>
          format and a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP request entity-body.
          When applicable, additional parameters required by the given client authentication method
          are also included (e.g. JWT assertion based client authentication uses
          <spanx style="verb">client_assertion</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">client_assertion_type</spanx>
          while Mutual TLS client authentication uses <spanx style="verb">client_id</spanx>).

          A signed authentication request is made by encoding all of the authentication request parameters as
          claims of a signed JWT, with each parameter name as the claim name and its value as a JSON string.
          The JWT MUST contain all of the authentication request parameters.
          The JWT MUST be secured with an asymmetric signature and follow the guidance from
          <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Signing">Section 10.1</eref> of
          <xref target="OpenID.Core"/> regarding asymmetric signatures.

          <t>
            User code is a mechanism to prevent unsolicited authentication requests from appearing on a user's authentication device.
          </t>
          <t>
            It is optional for the OP to implement user code functionality. If the OP implements user code functionality then it may allow 1) clients without user code and 2) users without user code.
          </t>
          <t>
            Typically clients that establish a security context with the user prior to sending a CIBA request should be allowed without user code. Example use cases of client security context are web applications that use CIBA for step-up authentication or call center applications where a caller ID is used to identify the user.
          </t>
          <t>
            The OP declares support for user code with the provider metadata parameter <spanx style="verb">backchannel_user_code_parameter_supported</spanx>.
          </t>
          <t>
            The Client registration parameter <spanx style="verb">backchannel_user_code_parameter</spanx> specifies if support for user code is required from the Client.
          </t>
          <t>
            A client may detect users who require a user code from the authentication request error code. For example a client may first attempt an authentication request without a user code, and only prompt for a user code if it receives the error code <spanx style="verb">missing_user_code</spanx>.
          </t>
          <t>
            The Client MUST NOT store the user code, but should rather request it from the user 
            for each CIBA flow.
          </t>
          <t>
            Registering a user code for a user is not in scope of this specification. Examples include 
            a facility provided by the authentication device, SMS text messages or other service provided 
            by the OP. OPs should provide a method for the user to change the user code.

      <t>
        When using the Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication flow, there is no interactive dialogue between

          <t>
            Error conditions associated with the authentication request are delivered to the Client by sending a <xref target="push_error_payload" format="title"/>  to the <xref target="backchannel_client_notification_endpoint" format="title"/>.

          <t>
            The Push Callback uses the parameters defined for a successful token response in Section 4.1.4 of <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0</xref> and Section 3.1.3.3 of <xref target="OpenID.Core"/>. In addition a new parameter "auth_req_id" is included in the payload. This is the authentication request identifier as defined in <xref target="successful_authentication_request_acknowdlegment">Successful Authentication Response</xref>.
          </t>
          <t>
            The Push Callback uses the application/json media type.
          </t>
           <t>
              In order to bind together the ID Token, the Access Token and the auth_req_id, the OP MUST include the hash value of the Access Token and the auth_req_id within the ID Token using the <spanx style="verb">at_hash</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">urn:openid:params:jwt:claim:auth_req_id</spanx> claims respectively.
              In case a Refresh Token is sent to the Client, the hash value of it MUST also be added to the ID token using the <spanx style="verb">urn:openid:params:jwt:claim:rt_hash</spanx> claim. Section 3.1.3.6 of <xref target="OpenID.Core"/> shows how to calculate the hash value of the access_token for <spanx style="verb">at_hash</spanx>,
              the same method can also be applied to calculate the Refresh Token hash value. Note that these claims are only required in Push mode.

        The login_hint_token SHOULD be digitally signed by the issuer.
        This ensures authenticity of the data and reduces the threat of an injection attack.
        The signature allows the OP to authenticate and authorize the sender of the hint and 
        prevent collecting of user identifiers by rogue Clients.
      </t>
      <t>
      The OP SHOULD ensure that the "backchannel_client_notification_endpoint" configured at registration time
      is in the administrative authority of the Client.
      Otherwise, the OP would post authentication results to the wrong Client.
      How this check is done is outside the scope of this specification.
      </t>
      <t>
        An id_token_hint cannot be validated using standard JWT processing rules because
        the token is being used in a context (sent from the Client back to the OP) that is different
        than that for which it was originally issued (typically a short lived token issued by
        the OP intended to convey claims about the authentication of an end-user to the Client).
        An expired ID Token therefore could still be considered valid as an id_token_hint so an OP should,
        for some reasonable period, accept id_token_hints with an expiration time that has passed.
        The OP should ensure that it is the issuer of the token and that
        the Client presenting the id_token_hint is listed in the audience claim.
        The OP should verify the signature to ensure that the token was, in fact, issued by it and
        hasn't been modified since. Note that due to key rotation, however, the OP may not
        necessarily have access to the key used to sign the token, so the length of time an
        ID Token is considered a valid hint will be likely to be limited by the OP's key rotation interval and
        retention period.

        Given these restrictions, implementers may consider not verifying the signature at all and
        only accepting ID Tokens with pairwise subject identifiers as hints.
        The OP could then validate that the Client authenticated at
        the Backchannel Authentication Endpoint was issued the pairwise subject identifier (or shares 
        a Sector Identifier with the Client who was issued the pairwise subject identifier).   
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification defines a method of token delivery, "Push Callback", which differs from standard OAuth 2.0 
        flows. Most OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect profiles require the Client to authenticate at the token endpoint 
        in order to retrieve access tokens, ID Tokens and refresh tokens. However with the CIBA Push mode, tokens are 
        delivered directly to the Client at its Client Notification Endpoint. Implementers should ensure that appropriate
        security controls are in place for this endpoint and its registration with the OP. CIBA requires that a hash of 
        the access token, a hash of the refresh token and the auth_req_id itself are included in the ID Token when the Push 
        mode is used. This allows the Client to verify that the values in the Push Callback have not been tampered with.

        This flow requires the Client to obtain an identifier for the end-user.  When this identifier is 
        a static global identifier, such as a phone number or email address, there are clear 
        privacy implications. However this flow does not require the use of such identifiers and in 
        deployments with higher privacy requirements, alternative identifiers could be used, such as:

            CIBA supports the use of ID Tokens as an <spanx style="verb">id_token_hint</spanx> in 
            the authentication request. If the OP has previously issued an ID Token to the Client 
            that contains a pairwise identifier and no personally identifiable information, then a 
            CIBA flow can be initialized without the RP asking the user for a static identifier.
            This ID Token may have been obtained by the Client via a standard front-channel 
            redirect flow. 
          </t>
          <t hangText="Single-use user identifier, transferred from the AD to the CD">
            The OP could generate a single-use identifier which could be transferred from the 
            Authentication Device to the Consumption Device at the start of the flow. For example,
            the user could authenticate on the AD and request an identifier for a CIBA flow. This could 
            be displayed as a QR code, the user could scan this QR code at the CD. The RP would then 
            decode the identifier and embed it in a <spanx style="verb">login_hint_token</spanx> which
            it would use to initiate a CIBA flow. The OP would then gain consent from the end-user for 
            the access requested by the RP.

          <t hangText="Discovery Service">
            For some ecosystems the RP may be able to send the user to a discovery service and receive
            back an encrypted <spanx style="verb">login_hint_token</spanx> which it can use in the 
            authentication request. The OP would decrypt the token, identify the user and continue the 
            CIBA flow.
