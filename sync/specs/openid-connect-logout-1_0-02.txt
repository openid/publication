            OpenID Connect HTTP-Based Logout 1.0 - draft 02

Abstract

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
   based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
   well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
   interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This specification defines an HTTP-based logout mechanism that does
   not need an OpenID Provider iframe on Relying Party pages.  Other
   protocols have used HTTP GETs to RP URLs that clear login state to
   achieve this.  This specification does the same thing.  It also
   reuses the RP-initiated logout functionality specified in Section 5
   of OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 (RP-Initiated Logout).

                  OpenID Connect HTTP-Based Logout 1.0       August 2015


1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749] protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the
   End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization
   Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-
   User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This specification defines an HTTP-based logout mechanism that does
   not need an OpenID Provider iframe on Relying Party pages.  Other
   protocols have used HTTP GETs to RP URLs that clear login state to
   achieve this.  This specification does the same thing.  It also
   reuses the RP-initiated logout functionality specified in Section 5
   of OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 [OpenID.Session] (RP-
   Initiated Logout).  This specification can be used separately from or
   in combination with OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   In the .txt version of this document, values are quoted to indicate
   that they are to be taken literally.  When using these values in
   protocol messages, the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.
   In the HTML version of this document, values to be taken literally
   are indicated by the use of "this fixed-width font".

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Authorization
   Code", "Authorization Endpoint", "Authorization Grant",
   "Authorization Server", "Client", "Client Identifier", "Client
   Secret", "Protected Resource", "Redirection URI", "Refresh Token",
   "Resource Owner", "Resource Server", "Response Type", and "Token
   Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], the term "User Agent"
   defined by RFC 7230 [RFC7230], and the terms defined by OpenID
   Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core].

   This specification also defines the following terms:

   Session
      Continuous period of time during which an End-User accesses a
      Relying Party relying on the Authentication of the End-User
      performed by the OpenID Provider.

   Session ID
      Identifier for a Session.

   IMPORTANT NOTE TO READERS: The terminology definitions in this
   section are a normative portion of this specification, imposing
   requirements upon implementations.  All the capitalized words in the
   text of this specification, such as "Session", reference these
   defined terms.  Whenever the reader encounters them, their
   definitions found in this section must be followed.

2.  Relying Party Logout Functionality

   RPs supporting HTTP-based logout register a logout URI with the OP as
   part of their client registration.  The domain, port, and scheme of
   this URL MUST be the same as that of a registered Redirection URI
   value.

   The logout URI MUST be an absolute URI as defined by [RFC3986]
   Section 4.3.  The logout URI MAY include an
   "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" formatted query component
   ([RFC3986] Section 3.4), which MUST be retained when adding
   additional query parameters.  The logout URI MUST NOT include a
   fragment component.

   The OP renders "<iframe src="logout_uri">" in a page with the
   registered logout URI as the source to trigger the logout actions by
   the RP.  Upon receiving a request to render the logout URI in an
   iframe, the RP clears state associated with the logged-in session,
   including any cookies and HTML5 local storage.

   The RP's response SHOULD include "Cache-Control" directives keeping
   the response from being cached to prevent cached responses from
   interfering with future logout requests.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   these directives be used:

     Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store
     Pragma: no-cache

   In the case that the RP is also an OP serving as an identity provider
   to downstream logged-in sessions, it is desirable for the logout
   request to the RP to likewise trigger downstream logout requests.
   This is achieved by having the RP serve content in the iframe that
   contains logout requests to the downstream sessions, which themselves
   are nested iframes rendering the downstream logout URIs.

   If the RP supports OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0
   [OpenID.Registration], it uses this metadata value to register the
   logout URI:

   logout_uri
      OPTIONAL.  RP URL that will cause the RP to log itself out when
      rendered in an iframe by the OP.  A "sid" (session ID) query
      parameter MAY be included by the OP to enable the RP to validate
      the request and to determine which of the potentially multiple
      sessions is to be logged out.

   It SHOULD also register this related metadata value:

                  OpenID Connect HTTP-Based Logout 1.0       August 2015


   logout_session_required
      OPTIONAL.  Boolean value specifying whether the RP requires that a
      "sid" (session ID) query parameter be included to identify the RP
      session at the OP when the "logout_uri" is used.  If omitted, the
      default value is "false".

3.  OpenID Provider Logout Functionality

   OPs supporting HTTP-based logout need to keep track of the set of
   logged-in RPs so that they know what RPs to contact at their logout
   URIs to cause them to log out.  Some OPs track this state using a
   "visited sites" cookie.  OPs contact them in parallel using a
   dynamically constructed page with HTML "<iframe src="logout_uri">"
   tags rendering each logged-in RP's logout URI.

   If the OP supports OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 [OpenID.Discovery],
   it uses this metadata value to advertise its support for HTTP-based
   logout:

   http_logout_supported
      OPTIONAL.  Boolean value specifying whether the OP supports HTTP-
      based logout, with "true" indicating support.  If omitted, the
      default value is "false".

   It SHOULD also register this related metadata value:

   logout_session_supported
      OPTIONAL.  Boolean value specifying whether the OP can pass a
      "sid" (session ID) query parameter to identify the RP session at
      the OP when the "logout_uri" is used.  If supported, the "sid"
      claim is also included in ID Tokens issued by the OP.  If omitted,
      the default value is "false".

   The "sid" (session ID) claim used in ID Tokens and as a "logout_uri"
   parameter has the following definition:

   sid (session ID)
      OPTIONAL.  String identifier for a Session - a pairing of an OP to
      a User Agent or device for a logged-in End-User.  Its contents are
      unique to the OP and opaque to the RP.  It MUST have sufficient
      entropy to prevent collisions between Session IDs generated by
      different OPs and to prevent it from being guessed by potential
      attackers.  Its syntax is the same as an OAuth 2.0 Client
      Identifier.

4.  RP-Initiated Logout Functionality

   This specification incorporates the RP-initiated logout functionality
   specified in Section 5 of OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0
   [OpenID.Session] by reference.  A summary follows.

   RPs supporting HTTP-based logout and OpenID Connect Dynamic Client
   Registration 1.0 [OpenID.Registration] MAY register this metadata
   value:

   post_logout_redirect_uris
      OPTIONAL.  Array of URLs supplied by the RP to which it MAY
      request that the End-User's User Agent be redirected using the
      "post_logout_redirect_uri" parameter after a logout has been
      performed.

   Post-logout redirection is only done when the logout is RP-initiated,
   in which case the redirection target is the
   "post_logout_redirect_uri" query parameter value used by the
   initiating RP; otherwise it is not done.

   OPs supporting HTTP-based logout and OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0
   [OpenID.Discovery] MUST provide this discovery value:

   end_session_endpoint
      REQUIRED.  URL at the OP to which an RP can perform a redirect to
      request that the End-User be logged out at the OP.

   The "end_session_endpoint" is used in exactly the same manner as
   specified in Sections 2.1 and 5 of OpenID Connect Session Management,
   including accepting the same query parameters as defined there in
   Section 5: "id_token_hint", "post_logout_redirect_uri", and "state".

5.  Security Considerations

   Collisions between Session IDs and the guessing of their values by
   attackers are prevented by including sufficient entropy in Session ID
   values.
