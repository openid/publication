Abstract

   This document defines the Risc Incident Sharing and Coordination
   (RISC) Event Types based on the Shared Signals and Events (SSE)
   Framework [SSE-FRAMEWORK].  Event Types are introduced and defined in
   Security Event Token (SET) [SET].

1.  Introduction

   This specification is based on SSE Framework [SSE-FRAMEWORK] and uses
   the subject identifiers defined there.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   new "john.row@example.com" email then *only* the email provider
   "example.com" SHOULD issue an Identifier Changed event as shown in
   the example below.

   If an identifier used as a username or recovery option is changed, at
   a provider that is not authoritative over that identifier, then
   Recovery Information Changed (Section 2.10) SHOULD be used instead.

   Attributes:

2.8.  Opt Out

   Users SHOULD be allowed to opt-in and out of RISC events being sent
   for their accounts.  With regards to opt-out an account can be in one
   of these three states:

   1.  opt-in - the account is participating in RISC event exchange.

   2.  opt-out-initiated - the user requested to be excluded from RISC
       event exchanges, but for practical security reasons for a period
       of time RISC events are still exchanged.  The main reason for
       this state is to prevent a hijacker from immediately opting out
       of RISC.

   3.  opt-out - the account is NOT participating in RISC event
       exchange.
