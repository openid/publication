            OpenID Connect MODRNA Authentication Profile 1.0
                openid-connect-modrna-authentication-1_0

Abstract

   RPs are keen to use high quality authentication methods, which can be
   provided by Mobile Network Operators (MNO).  However a RP must be
   able to describe its demands for an authentication request and it
   must be able to do this in an interoperable way.

   The MODRNA Authentication Profile will specify how RP's request a
   certain level of assurance for the authentication.

   In addition, the profile will specify an encrypted login hint token
   to allow for the transport of user identifiers to the OP in a privacy
   preserving fashion.

   Lastly, the profile will specify an additional messge parameter
   intended to serve as an interlock between the user's consumpution
   device and authentication device.

1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect MODRNA Authentication Profile 1.0 is a profile of the
   OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core] specification that defines
   common authentication contexts and further extensions to OpenID
   Connect Core to be used when requesting authentication from MNO's.
   Moreover it defines Mandatory to Implement features for MNOs to
   assure interoperability of clients across MNO's.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are
   to be taken literally.  When using these values in protocol messages,
   the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the termn "OpenID Provider (OP)" and "Relying
   Party (RP)" as defined by OpenID Connect Core [OpenID.Core].  This
   specification also defines the following terms:

   Mobile Network Operator (MNO)  A provider of wireless communication
      services that owns or controls the wireless network elements
      necessary to sell and deliver services to an end user.

   Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number (MSISDN)  A
      telephone number uniquely identifying a subscription in a mobile
      network.

   Consumption Device (CD)  A user agent, most probably a browser, on
      which the user consumes the actual service provided by the Relying
      Party.

   Authentication Device (AD)  A mobile device on which the user will
      authenticate the actual login.

                 OIDC MODRNA Authentication Profile 1.0       March 2017


2.  Overview

   This specification serves as a profile based on OpenID Connect Core
   [OpenID.Core].  It defines additional request parameters in the
   Authentication Request.  It also specifies authentication class
   reference values based on the ISO/IEC DIS 29115 [ISO.29115] to be
   used for the "acr_values" request parameter.

3.  Authentication Request

   MODRNA supports all request parameters as specified in OpenID Connect
   Core 3.1.2.1 [OpenID.Core].

   In addition the following parameters are defined or made REQUIRED for
   clients to send.  All additional paramaters are REQUIRED for OP to
   support.

   acr_values  REQUIRED.  In [OpenID.Core] this parameter is specified
      as OPTIONAL.  For MODRNA this parameter is REQUIRED in order to
      enable the Relying Party to indicate a MODRNA conform
      authentication request to the OP.  Allowed values are defined in
      Section 4.

   login_hint_token  OPTIONAL.  This is a new parameter.  The
      login_hint_token is used to transport a user identifier from the
      Discovery Service to the OpenID Provider without revealing this
      identifier to the client.  Section 6 specifies the structure of
      this parameter.  Protection of the login_hint_token's content is
      specified in Section 6.1.

   binding_message  OPTIONAL.  This is a new parameter.  An Interlock
      message to tie the consumption device and the authentication
      device together.  How to ensure that the message is actually shown
      on all relevant devices is out of the scope of this document.
      Possible values and constraints are specified in Section 7.  Ways
      to protect the integrity of the binding_message are discussed in
      Section 9.

4.  acr_values request values and level of assurance

   The service's terms of service will specify a trust framework for
   Identity Providers to follow for general business processes and other
   related account security issues.

   This specification defines an initial set of "acr" values that
   clients can use to request the IdP mitigate specific authentication
   risks.

                 OIDC MODRNA Authentication Profile 1.0       March 2017


   The initial set of "acr" values contain no requirements for the IdP
   to make any guarantee of identity proofing the subject of the
   authentication beyond what is required by business practices for
   account recovery and customer service as defined in the trust
   framework.  Prepaid anonymous users may be included in responses
   conforming to these values.

   The IANA Level of Assurance (LoA) Profiles [RFC6711] Registry will be
   used to register the short names for these LoA, and any future
   additional LoA.

   http://schemas.openid.net/policies/modrna/phishing-resistant  Short-
      Name: mod-pr
      This mitigates phishing of credentials.
      The user is authenticated via possession of a device (phone)
      containing a secret key.  The user is required to provide no
      additional authentication information to use the key.  The user is
      interactively prompted to confirm the authentication.  The storage
      mechanism for the secret key and other relevant authentication
      information is returned via the "amr".  The user is not re-
      prompted for credentials if the value of "prompt" is not login and
      "max_age" is more than the elapsed time since the user last
      authenticated at the requested acr.

   http://schemas.openid.net/policies/modrna/multi-factor  Short-Name:
      mod-mf
      This mitigates phishing and proves the device is recently in the
      possession of the authorised user via pin or device unlock.
      The user is authenticated via possession of a device (phone)
      containing a secret key.  The user is required to provide
      additional authentication information via a biometric, pin code or
      other appropriate factors such as bluetooth paring with a watch.
      Given suitable Mobile device management unlocking the device is
      also sufficient along with user confirmation of desire to
      authenticate.  The storage mechanism for the secret key and other
      relevant authentication information is returned via the "amr"
      value.  The user is not re-prompted for credentials if the value
      of "prompt" is not login and "max_age" is more than the elapsed
      time since the user last authenticated at the requested acr.

   Identity Providers MUST recognize and process short registered forms
   of the authentication context strings.  They may recognize and
   process long forms for custom authentication contexts.

   Clients MUST send the short registered forms of the authentication
   context strings, if the authentication context is registered.

   The OP MUST support receiving "acr_values" as a space separated list
   in order of preference per OpenID Connect Core 3.1.2.1 [OpenID.Core].

   The OP MUST support receiving "acr" as a claim request in a signed
   request per OpenID Connect Core 5.5.1 [OpenID.Core].  This method
   prevents the request from being modified by the user, and allows the
   requested "acr" valued to be considered essential claims causing the
   IdP to respond with an authentication error if no requested "acr"
   value can be fulfilled.

   Depending on the authentication capabilities of the users device, the
   OP must attempt to match the highest requested acr value that the AD
   is capable of.  If the acr claim is not marked as essential in the
   request object, the OP may return another acr value that the device
   is capable of rather than an error if it cannot match any of the
   requested acr_values.

5.  Authentication Method Reference (amr)

   The "amr" claim OpenID Connect Core Sec 2 [OpenID.Core] SHOULD be
   returned in the id_token if a "acr" value is specified in the
   request.
   The "amr" claim is a JSON array containing one or more string values
   indicating the authentication methods used in the authentication.

   The values for the strings in the "amr" claim are registered in a
   IANA registry defined in Authentication Method Reference Values
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-amr-values].

   This specification recommends the use of several of the values, to
   provide a standard way for clients to understand the authentication

   user  User presence test.

   pin  A Personal Identification Number or pattern (Not restricted to
      numbers only) that a user used to unlock a key on the device.
      This mechanism SHOULD have a way to deter an attacker from
      guessing the pin by making multiple guesses.

   fpt  Fingerprint biometric

   sms  Confirmation by responding to a SMS sent to a known device.

   swk  Proof-of-possession (PoP) of a software-secured key.

   hwk  Proof-of-possession (PoP) of a hardware-secured key.

   geo  Geo-Location of the authentication device.

5.1.  AMR Value Examples

   If the authentication is performed by sending the users mobile device
   a SMS with a URI and having the user click on the link to confirm, it
   SHOULD have a "amr" value of ["sms","user"]

   If the authentication is by sending a secure message to a hardware
   element in mobile device's and the HW element signs a authentication
   challenge only after the user has entered a local PIN then it SHOULD
   have a "amr" value of ["hpop","pin"]

   If the authentication is by sending a secure message to a software
   application in the mobile device that signs a authentication
   challenge only after the user has entered a local fingerprint
   biometric then it SHOULD have a "amr" value of ["pop","fpt"]

   If the authentication is by sending a secure message to a hardware
   element in mobile device's and the HW element signs a authentication
   challenge only after the user has entered a local fingerprint
   biometric, and the IdP has preformed additional passive analytics
   based on geo location, then it SHOULD have a "amr" value of
   ["hpop","fpt","geo"]

   Note that if two or more authentication factors are used the MNO may
   include the "amr" value "mfa" and optionally not include the specific
   factors.
   Note: that the order of elements in the "amr" array is not
   significant.

6.  login_hint_token

   The "login_hint_token" is used to pass a user hint into the
   authentication process at the OP.  This hint is opaque to the client
   by design.  There are several ways for a client to obtain a login
   hint token.  To start with, the MODRNA discovery service
   [MODRNA.Discovery] creates a hint if the user has entered their
   MSISDN in the course of the MNO discovery process.

   In the case of a "login_hint_token" produced by the MODRNA Discovery
   Service it is an encrypted Json Web Token JWT [RFC7519] that contains
   a user hint for the OP.  The "login_hint_token" SHALL be used by the
   client as login hint with OP identified by the MODRNA discovery
   service [MODRNA.Discovery].  In this case, the login hint token is
   supposed to be a signed and encrypted JWT.

   The Authorization server may produce "login_hint_token" tokens in
   other formats for use in Account Chooser or other discovery profiles,
   as long as they are confidentiality protected from the client.

                 OIDC MODRNA Authentication Profile 1.0       March 2017


   The "login_hint_token" produced by the MODRNA discovery service
   [MODRNA.Discovery] has the following elements:

   iss  REQUIRED.  The party creating the token.  This value MUST be
      used by the IdP receiving the token to obtain the JWK [RFC7517]
      file required to validate the tokens's signature (see
      Section 6.1).

   aud  REQUIRED.  The party to receive the token, typically the users
      OpenID Provider.  The value MUST be the issuer URI of the OP as
      exposed in the IdP's openid-configuration meta-data.

   iat  REQUIRED.  When the token was issued.

   MSISDN  REQUIRED.  The Subscriber identifier formated according to
      ITU-T recommendation [E.164]

   The following is a non-normative example of JWT body (with line wraps
   within values for display purposes only):

     {
      "iss": "https://discovery-provider.com",
      "aud": "https://babytel.com",
      "iat": 1311280970,
      "MSISDN": "+1999550123"
     }

6.1.  login_hint_token encryption and signing

   The login_hint token MUST be encrypted using the public key of the
   OpenID Provider designated by the claim "aud" in the
   login_hint_token.  The appropriate public key is obtained using the
   rules defined in OpenID Connect Discovery.  [OpenID.Discovery]

   In the first step, the openid-configuration for the IdP is retrieved
   by performing discovery Per Section 4 of [OpenID.Discovery] using the
   issuer string for the users IdP as the input.
   In the next step, the value of the "jwks_uri" claim Per Section 3 of
   [OpenID.Discovery] is used to retrieve the OP's JWK [RFC7517].  A
   public key in the JWK with a use paramater of "enc" per Section 4.2
   of JWK [RFC7517] is used as the encryption key.  The login_hint_token
   is then encrypted as a JWE using that key.

   The login_hint token MUST be signed using the private key of the
   Discovery Service.

                 OIDC MODRNA Authentication Profile 1.0       March 2017


   It is best practice to sign then encrypt tokens, as signatures over
   encrypted information may leak information in the envelope, and may
   not be considered legally valid.

   For an example of a nested JWT that is signed and then encrypted see
   Appendix 2 of JWT [RFC7519].

   NOTE: The "login_hint_token" is opaque to the client by design.  The
   Authorization server may produce "login_hint_token" tokens in other
   formats for use in Account Chooser or other discovery profiles, as
   long as they are confidentiality protected from the client.

7.  binding_message

   The "binding_message" parameter is a text provided by the RP intended
   to be shown to the user on the consumption device as well as on the
   authentication device as an interlock between RP and OP.

   The "binding_message" MUST be plain text using the "application/x-
   www-form-urlencoded" format as the authentication device in
   particular may have limited abilities to show text or formats.

   The "binding_message" SHOULD be displayable on all participating
   devices.  The RP SHOULD consider that some authentication devices
   e.g. as SIM-Applets are able to show only a very limited number of
   characters.

8.  mandatory to implement

   acr_values  All MODRNA compliant OP's MUST accept the acr_values
      specified in Section 4

9.  Security Considerations

   The login hint token SHOULD be digitally signed by the issuer.  This
   ensures authenticity of the data and reduces the threat of an
   injection attack.  The signature allows the OP to authenicate and
   authorize the sender of the hint and prevent collecting of phone
   numbers by rogue clients.

   To prevent modification of the "binding_message" value, the RP SHOULD
   send the parameter to the OP using a signed OpenID Connect Request
   Object (section 6.3.2 of [OpenID.Core]).

   The OP MUST sanitize the "binding_message" value in order to prevent
   injection attacks.

                 OIDC MODRNA Authentication Profile 1.0       March 2017


   The "binding_message" value being displayed on the consumption and
   authentication device SHOULD contain a random value (e.g. an
   authorization code) of reasonable entropy.  This is a countermeasure
   against session fixation type attacks, where the attacker initiates
   an authentication process on a consumption device under his control,
   which will result in the same text being displayed on the
   authentication device as for legitimate transactions.

10.  Privacy Considerations

   The login hint token is encrypted in order to protect the user's
   MSISDN from being revealed to the client unintentionally.

11.  IANA Considerations

   TBD: Find out about how to correctly add entries to IANA for:
