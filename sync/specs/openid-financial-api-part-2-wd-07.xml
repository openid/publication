    <note title="Introduction">
      <t>Fintech is an area of future economic growth around the world and Fintech organizations need to improve the security of their operations and protect customer data. It is common practice of aggregation services to use screen scraping as a method to capture data by storing users' passwords. This brittle, inefficient, and insecure practice creates security vulnerabilities which require financial institutions to allow what appears to be an automated attack against their applications and to maintain a whitelist of aggregators. A new draft standard, proposed by this workgroup would instead utilize an API model with structured data and a token model, such as OAuth [RFC6749, RFC6750].</t>
      <t>The Financial-grade API aims to provide specific implementation guidelines for online financial services to adopt by developing a REST/JSON data model protected by a highly secured OAuth profile. The Financial-grade API security profile can be applied to online services in any market area that requires a higher level of security than provided by standard OAuth or OpenID Connect.</t>
      <t>This document is Part 2 of FAPI that specifies the Financial-grade API and it provides a profile of OAuth that is suitable to be used for high risk access (read or write), for example, read access to highly sensitive data or write access to financial data (also known as payment initiation). This document specifies the controls against attacks such as: authorization request tampering, authorization response tampering including code injection, state injection, and token request phishing. Additional details are available in the security considerations section.</t>
      <t>Although it is possible to code an OpenID Provider and Relying Party from first principles using this specification, the main audience for this specification is parties who already have a certified implementation of OpenID Connect and want to achieve a higher level of security. Implementers are encouraged to understand the security considerations contained in section 8.7 before embarking on a 'from scratch' implementation.</t>

These APIs are protected by the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework that consists of [RFC6749], [RFC6750], [RFC7636], and other specifications.  </t><t>There are different levels of risks associated with access to these APIs. For example, read and write access to a bank API has a higher financial risk than read-only access. As such, the security profiles of the authorization framework protecting these APIs are also different.  </t><t>This profile describes security provisions for the server and client that are appropriate for Financial-grade APIs by defining the measures to mitigate: </t><t><list style="symbols"><t>attacks that leverage the weak binding of endpoints in [RFC6749] (e.g. malicious endpoint attacks, IdP mix-up attacks), </t><t>attacks that modify authorization requests and responses unprotected in [RFC6749] </t></list></t><t>This profile does not support public clients.  </t><t>The following ways are specified to cope with modifications of authorization responses: Implementations can leverage OpenID Connect's Hybrid Flow that returns an ID Token in the authorization response or they can utilize the JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode for OAuth 2.0 (JARM) that returns and protects all authorization response parameters in a JWT.  </t><section title="ID Token as Detached Signature" anchor="id-token-as-detached-signature" toc="default"><t>While the name ID Token (as used in the OpenID Connect Hybrid Flow) suggests that it is something that provides the identity of the resource owner (subject), it is not necessarily so. While it does identify the authorization server by including the issuer identifier, it is perfectly fine to have an ephemeral subject identifier. In this case, the ID Token acts as a detached signature of the issuer to the authorization response and it was an explicit design decision of OpenID Connect Core to make the ID Token act as a detached signature.  </t><t>This document leverages this fact and protects the authorization response by including the hash of all of the unprotected response parameters, e.g. <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">code</spanx> and <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">state</spanx>, in the ID Token.  </t><t>While the hash of the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">code</spanx> is defined in [OIDC], the hash of the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">state</spanx> is not defined.  Thus this document defines it as follows.  </t><t><spanx style="strong" xml:space="preserve">s_hash</spanx> </t><t><list style="empty"><t>State hash value. Its value is the base64url encoding of the left-most half of the hash of the octets of the ASCII representation of the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">state</spanx> value, where the hash algorithm used is the hash algorithm used in the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">alg</spanx> header parameter of the ID Token's JOSE header. For instance, if the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">alg</spanx> is <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">HS512</spanx>, hash the state value with SHA-512, then take the left-most 256 bits and base64url encode them.  The <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">s_hash</spanx> value is a case sensitive string.  </t></list></t></section><section title="JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode for OAuth 2.0 (JARM)" anchor="jwt-secured-authorization-response-mode-for-oauth-2.0-jarm" toc="default"><t>An authorization server may protect authorization responses to clients using the "JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode" <xref target="jarm-1" pageno="false" format="default">JARM</xref>.  </t><t>The <xref target="jarm-1" pageno="false" format="default">JARM</xref> allows a client to request that an authorization server encodes the authorization response (of any response type) in a JWT. It is an alternative to utilizing ID Tokens as detached signatures for providing financial-grade security on authorization responses and can be used with plain OAuth.  </t><t>This specification facilitates use of <xref target="jarm-1" pageno="false" format="default">JARM</xref> in conjunction with the response type <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">code</spanx>.  </t><t>Note: <xref target="jarm-1" pageno="false" format="default">JARM</xref> can be used to protect OpenID Connect authentication responses. In this case, the OpenID RP would use response type <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">code</spanx>, response mode <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">jwt</spanx> and scope <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">openid</spanx>. This means <xref target="jarm-1" pageno="false" format="default">JARM</xref> protects the authentication response (instead of the ID Token) and the ID Token containing End-User Claims is obtained from the token endpoint. This facilitates privacy since no End-User Claims are sent through the front channel. It also provides decoupling of message protection and identity providing since a client (or RP) can basically use <xref target="jarm-1" pageno="false" format="default">JARM</xref> to protect all authorization responses and turn on OpenID if needed (e.g. to log the user in).  </t></section></section><section title="Advanced security provisions" anchor="advanced-security-provisions" toc="default"><section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction-1" toc="default"><t>Read and write access carries higher risk; therefore the protection level required is higher than read-only access.  </t><t>As a profile of The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework, this document mandates the following for the advanced profile of the FAPI.  </t></section><section title="Authorization server" anchor="authorization-server" toc="default"><t>The authorization server shall support the provisions specified in clause 5.2.2 of Financial-grade API - Part 1: Baseline Security Profile, with the exception that section 5.2.2.7 (enforcement of [RFC7636]) is not required.  </t><t>In addition, the authorization server </t><t><list style="numbers"><t>shall require the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">request</spanx> or <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">request_uri</spanx> parameter to be passed as a JWS signed JWT as in clause 6 of [OIDC]; </t><t>shall require <list style="numbers"><t>the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">response_type</spanx> value <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">code id_token</spanx> or </t><t>the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">response_type</spanx> value <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">code</spanx> in conjunction with the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">response_mode</spanx> value <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">jwt</spanx>; </t></list> </t><t>(moved to 5.2.2.1) </t><t>shall only issue sender-constrained access tokens; </t><t>shall support [MTLS] as mechanism for constraining the legitimate senders of access tokens; </t><t>(withdrawn); </t><t>(moved to 5.2.2.1); </t><t>(moved to 5.2.2.1); </t><t>shall only use the parameters included in the signed request object passed in the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">request</spanx> or <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">request_uri</spanx> parameter; </t><t>may support the pushed authorization request endpoint as described in [PAR]; </t><t>(withdrawn); </t><t>shall require the request object to contain an <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">exp</spanx> claim that has a lifetime of no longer than 60 minutes after the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">nbf</spanx> claim; and </t><t>shall authenticate the confidential client using one of the following methods (this overrides FAPI Part 1 clause 5.2.2.4): <list style="numbers"><t><spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">tls_client_auth</spanx> or <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">self_signed_tls_client_auth</spanx> as specified in section 2 of [MTLS]; </t><t><spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">private_key_jwt</spanx> as specified in section 9 of [OIDC]; </t></list> </t><t>shall require the aud claim in the request object to be, or to be an array containing, the OP's Issuer Identifier URL; </t><t>shall not support public clients; </t><t>shall require the request object to contain an <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">nbf</spanx> claim that is no longer than 60 minutes in the past; and </t><t>shall require [PAR] requests, if supported, to use PKCE ([RFC7636]) with <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">S256</spanx> as the code challenge method.  </t></list></t><t><spanx style="strong" xml:space="preserve">NOTE:</spanx> MTLS is currently the only mechanism for sender-constrained access tokens that has been widely deployed.

There is no notion of authorization server identifier (issuer identifier) and it is not indicated in the authorization response unless the client uses different redirection URI per authorization server. While it is assumed in the OAuth model, it is not explicitly spelled out and thus many clients use the same redirection URI for different authorization servers exposing an attack surface.  Several attacks have been identified and the threats are explained in detail in [RFC6819].  </t></section><section title="Client credential and authorization code phishing at token endpoint" anchor="client-credential-and-authorization-code-phishing-at-token-endpoint" toc="default"><t>In this attack, the client developer is socially engineered into believing that the token endpoint has changed to the URL that is controlled by the attacker. As a result, the client sends the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">code</spanx> and the client secret to the attacker, which will be replayed subsequently.  </t><t>When the FAPI client uses [MTLS], the client's secret (the private key corresponding to its TLS certificate) is not exposed to the attacker, which therefore cannot authenticate towards the token endpoint of the authorization server.  </t></section><section title="Identity provider (IdP) mix-up attack" anchor="identity-provider-idp-mix-up-attack" toc="default"><t>In this attack, the client has registered multiple IdPs and one of them is a rogue IdP that returns the same <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">client_id</spanx> that belongs to one of the honest IdPs. When a user clicks on a malicious link or visits a compromised site, an authorization request is sent to the rogue IdP. The rogue IdP then redirects the client to the honest IdP that has the same <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">client_id</spanx>. If the user is already logged on at the honest IdP, then the authentication may be skipped and a code is generated and returned to the client.  Since the client was interacting with the rogue IdP, the code is sent to the rogue IdP's token endpoint. At the point, the attacker has a valid code that can be exchanged for an access token at the honest IdP.  </t><t>This is mitigated by the use of OpenID Connect Hybrid Flow in which the honest IdP's issuer identifier is included as the value of <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">iss</spanx> or <xref target="jarm-1" pageno="false" format="default">JARM</xref> where the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">iss</spanx> included in the response JWT. On receiving the authorization response, the client compares the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">iss</spanx> value from the response with the issuer URL of the IdP it sent the authorization request to (the rogue IdP).

However in some deployments the certificates used for [MTLS] are issued by a Certificate Authority at an organisation level rather than a client level. In such situations it may be common for an organisation with multiple clients to use the same certificates (or certificates with the same DN) across clients.

Implementers are advised to perform a thorough privacy impact assessment and and manage identified risks appropriately.  </t><t>NOTE: Implementers can consult documents like [ISO29100] and [ISO29134] for this purpose.  </t><t>Privacy threats to OAuth and OpenID Connect implementations include the following: </t><t><list style="symbols"><t>(Inappropriate privacy notice) A privacy notice provided at a <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">policy_url</spanx> or by other means can be inappropriate.  </t><t>(Inadequate choice) Providing a consent screen without adequate choices does not form consent.  </t><t>(Misuse of data) An AS, RS or Client can potentially use the data not according to the purpose that was agreed.  </t><t>(Collection minimization violation) Clients asking for more data than it absolutely needs to fulfil the purpose is violating the collection minimization principle.  </t><t>(Unsolicited personal data from the Resource) Some bad resource server implementations may return more data than was requested. If the data is personal data, then this would be a violation of privacy principles.  </t><t>(Data minimization violation) Any process that is processing more data than it needs is violating the data minimization principle.  </t><t>(RP tracking by AS/OP) AS/OP identifying what data is being provided to which Client/RP.  </t><t>(User tracking by RPs) Two or more RPs correlating access tokens or ID Tokens to track users.  </t><t>(RP misidentification by User at AS) User misunderstands who the RP is due to a confusing representation of the RP at the AS's authorization page.  </t><t>(Mismatch between User&#8217;s understanding or what RP is displaying to a user and the actual authorization request). To enhance the trust of the ecosystem, best practice is for the AS to make clear what is included in the authorisation request (for example, what data will be released to the RP).  </t><t>(Attacker observing personal data in authorization request) Authorization request might contain personal data. This can be observed by an attacker.  </t><t>(Attacker observing personal data in authorization endpoint response) In some frameworks, even state is deemed personal data.
