       Initiating User Registration via OpenID Connect - draft 03
                    openid-connect-prompt-create-1_0

Abstract

   An extension to the OpenID Connect Authentication Framework defining
   a new value for the "prompt" parameter that instructs the OpenID
   Provider to start the user flow with user registration and after the
   user account has been created return an authorization code to the
   client to complete the authentication flow.

1.  Introduction

   Several years of deployment and implementation experience with OpenID
   Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core] has uncovered a need, in some
   circumstances, for the client to explicitly signal to the OpenID
   Provider that the user desires to create a new account rather than
   authenticate an existing identity.

   This allows the client to indicate to the OpenID Provider that the
   user desires to create an account.  This improves the user experience
   because the user doesn't have to first see the login form and then
   find the sign-up link on the form and select it before getting to the
   user's desired action.

   This specification defines a new parameter value for the "prompt"
   parameter.

2.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   In the .txt version of this specification, values are quoted to
   indicate that they are to be taken literally.  When using these
   values in protocol messages, the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of
   the value.  In the HTML version of this specification, values to be
   taken literally are indicated by the use of "this fixed-width font".

3.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "authorization endpoint",
   "authorization request", "authorization response", and "client"
   defined by The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC6749].

4.  Prompt Parameter

   In requests to the OpenID Provider, a client MAY indicate that the
   desired user experience is for the user to immediately see the user
   account creation UI instead of the login behavior.

   prompt
      A value of "create" indicates to the OpenID Provider that the
      client desires that the user be shown the account creation UX
      rather than the login flow.  Care must be taken if combining this
      value with other "prompt" values.  Mututally exclusive conditions
      can arise so it is RECOMMENDED that "create" not be present with
      any other values.

4.1.  Authorization Request

   When the "prompt" parameter is used in an authorization request to
   the authorization endpoint with the value of "create", it indicates
   that the user has chosen to be shown the account creation experience
   rather than the login experience.  Whether the AS creates a brand new
   identity or helps the user authenticate an identity they already have
   is out of scope for this specification.  The behavior is the same for
   both the implicit flow (Section 3.2 of OpenID Connect Core 1.0
   [OpenID.Core]), and the authorization code flow (Section 3.1 of
   OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core]).

   For authorization requests sent as a JWTs, such as when using JWT
   Secured Authorization Request [I-D.ietf-oauth-jwsreq], the "prompt"

   claim value MUST be a space delimited set of prompt values in keeping
   with Section 3.1.2.1 of OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core].

   How the OpenID Provider handles prompt values that it fails to parse
   is out of scope for this specification.  -or- If the OpenID Provider
   fails to parse the provided value(s) it should ignore the "prompt"
   parameter value and proceed as if the "prompt" parameter was not
   specified.

   An example of an authorization request where the client tells the
   OpenID Provider that it wants the user to start from the account
   creation user experience is shown in Figure 1 below (extra line
   breaks and indentation are for display purposes only).

     GET /as/authorization.oauth2?response_type=token
        &client_id=example-client
        &state=XzZaJlcwYew1u0QBrRv_Gw
        &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Eorg%2Fcb
        &prompt=create
        &scope=openid%20profile HTTP/1.1
     Host: authorization-server.example.com

               Figure 1: Implicit Flow Authorization Request

   Below in Figure 2 is an example of an authorization request using the
   "code" response type where the the client tells the OpenID Provider
   that it wants the user to start from the account creation user
   experience (extra line breaks and indentation are for display
   purposes only).

     GET /as/authorization.oauth2?response_type=code
        &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
        &state=tNwzQ87pC6llebpmac_IDeeq-mCR2wLDYljHUZUAWuI
        &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Eorg%2Fcb
        &scope=openid%20profile
        &prompt=create HTTP/1.1
     Host: authorization-server.example.com
