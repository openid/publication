        OpenID Connect Native SSO for Mobile Apps 1.0 - draft 05
                     openid-connect-native-sso-1_0

Abstract

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
   based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
   well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
   interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This document describes a mechanism that allows a mobile app to share
   the identity/authentication obtained by a different mobile app where
   both apps are written by the same vendor.

1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749] protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the
   End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization
   Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-
   User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

   As the industry moves to a more mobile oriented environment, vendors
   need a way to share identity across the multiple mobile apps they
   deploy.  While the current OAuth2 best practice allows for SSO across
   any mobile app by sharing the session cookies in the system browser,
   this has risks such as a user clearing their system browser of
   cookies (possibly as requested by a customer care agent) or using
   private browsing on iOS and Android.  On most mobile platforms,
   mobile apps signed by the same vendor certs can share information via
   the system "keychain" (Account Manager on Android).

   This document specifies a new scope, extends the token endpoint and
   profiles the OAuth2 Token Exchange [RFC8693] spec allowing mobile
   apps to share identity (SSO) between apps produced and signed by the
   same vendor (i.e. signed with the same vendor certificate).

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   In the .txt version of this specification, values are quoted to
   indicate that they are to be taken literally.  When using these
   values in protocol messages, the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of
   the value.  In the HTML version of this specification, values to be
   taken literally are indicated by the use of this fixed-width font.

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Authorization Server", "Client",
   "Client Identifier", and "Redirection URI" defined by OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749], the term "User Agent" defined by RFC 7230 [RFC7230], the
   term "native app" defined by RFC 8252 [RFC8252] and the terms defined
   by OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core].

   This specification also defines the following terms:

   Device Secret
      Opaque value to the client, issued by the Authorization Server,
      that uniquely identifies the device instance and provides
      credentials for the device.

   Session ID
      Identifier for a user's authentication session.

   Steps [1] - [8] are the standard OpenID Connect authorization_code
   flow with the following extensions.  In step 2, the device_sso scope
   is specified signifying that the client is requesting a device_secret
   to be returned when the code is exchanged for tokens.

   After step 8, Native App #1 stores the device_secret and id_token in
   the protected device storage accessible only to Native App #2.

   Native App #2 uses the stored data from the shared device storage to
   obtain tokens for the user thus enabling the app to access the user's
   resources (i.e.  SSO)

   Step [9] invokes the /token endpoint with the token exchange profile
   passing the id_token obtained from the shared device storage, the
   client_id and the device secret.

   Step [10] returns the SSO generated refresh and access tokens for
   Native App #2.

3.  Native App Authorization Extensions

   The following sections describe the extensions required to the
   standard OpenID Connect Authentication flow which will enable a
   second mobile app to share the authentication of the first mobile app
   where both mobile applications are signed by the same vendor
   certificates.

3.1.  Authorization Request

   This specification defines a new scope value that is used to convey
   to the Authorization Server that when the code is exchanged for a
   token, a new device_secret will be returned in addition to the other
   tokens identified as part of the authorization request.




Fletcher                     Standards Track                    [Page 4]

                          Mobile App Native SSO            November 2022


   The new scope value is defined as device_sso.  When this scope is
   present on the authorization request, when the code is exchanged for
   tokens, a new device_secret will be returned.

3.2.  Device Secret

   The device secret contains relevant data to the device and the
   current users authenticated with the device.  The device secret is
   completely opaque to the client and as such the AS MUST adequately
   protect the value such as using a JWE if the AS is not maintaining
   state on the backend.

   In the context of this extension the device secret may be shared
   between mobile apps that can obtain the value via the shared security
   mechanism (e.g. keychain on iOS).  If a mobile app requests a device
   secret via the device_sso scope and a device_secret exists, then the
   client MUST provide the device_secret on the request to the /token
   endpoint to exchange code for tokens.  The client SHOULD provide the
   device_secret to the /token endpoint during refresh token requests so
   that the AS may rotate the device_secret as necessary.

   The exact construction of the device_secret is out of scope for this
   specification.

3.3.  Token Request

   During a normal user authentication via the system browser, after the
   mobile app receives the code and state response from the
   Authorization Server, this spec defines the following additional
   parameters to the /token endpoint for the authorization_code
   grant_type.

   device_secret
      OPTIONAL.  This token SHOULD be provided if the client requested
      the device_sso scope and the client already has a device_secret
      available.  If no device_secret is specified and the refresh_token
      contains the device_sso scope, a new device_secret will be
      generated.

3.4.  Token Response

   When the authorization server receives the device_secret value it
   MUST process the authorization_code grant type per the OpenID Connect
   spec with the following additions applying to the id_token.

   1.  Add a ds_hash claim to the id_token to represent a function of
       the device_secret.




Fletcher                     Standards Track                    [Page 5]

                          Mobile App Native SSO            November 2022


       ds_hash
          REQUIRED.  The ds_hash value provides a binding between the
          id_token and the issued device_secret.  The exact binding
          between the ds_hash and device_secret is not specified by this
          profile.  As this binding is managed solely by the
          Authorization Server, the AS can choose how to protect the
          relationship between the id_token and device_secret.

   2.  Add a session id to the id_token that represents the user's
       current authentication session.

       sid
          REQUIRED.  A string that uniquely identifies this user's
          authentication session.  This value can be used in logout
          flows as well as the flow this spec is describing.  For mobile
          apps where there is no explicit browser authentication this
          value SHOULD represent the underlying session associated with
          the refresh_token.

   Note that the implementation of this spec and the specification of
   the ds_hash and sid value MUST NOT leak any data that would provide a
   security advantage to an attacker who gains access to the id_token.

   When the authorization server receives the device_secret it must
   validate the token.  If the token is invalid it must be discarded and
   the request processed as if no device_secret was specified.

   If the authorization request included the device_sso scope then the
   authorization server MUST return a device_secret in the response.
   The device_secret is returned in the device_token claim of the
   returned JSON data.

   If no devices_secret is specified, then the AS MUST generate the
   token.  If a device_secret is specified and is valid, the AS MAY
   update the device_secret as necessary.  Regardless a device_secret
   must be returned in the response.

4.  Token Exchange Profile for Native SSO

   This section profiles the OAuth2 Token Exchange [RFC8693] spec and
   describes the processing rules used to exchange a previous
   authentication for new refresh and access tokens requested by a
   mobile app created by the same vendor as the first mobile app and
   both apps signed by the same developer certificate.

                          Mobile App Native SSO            November 2022


4.1.  OAuth2 Token Exchange Profile

   The client authenticates using its registered token endpoint client
   authentication method.  This could range from HTTP Basic
   Authentication, to OpenID Connect defined private_key_jwt.  The AS
   must be able to obtain the client_id of the requesting mobile app
   (mobile app #2) from the client authentication method.

   This profile defines the use of the following token exchange
   parameters.

   grant_type
      REQUIRED.  The value MUST be urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-
      type:token-exchange

   audience
      REQUIRED.  This parameter defines the logical purview of the
      returned tokens.  For the purposes of this profile, this value
      MUST be the issuer URI for the OpenID Provider that issued the
      id_token used in this profile.

   subject_token
      REQUIRED.  This parameter MUST contain the id_token obtained by
      the first native app.  The id_token is used in the same manner as
      id_token_hint to identify the user to SSO into the invoking native
      app.

   subject_token_type
      REQUIRED.  This parameter MUST contain the value:
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token

   actor_token
      REQUIRED.  This value defines the actor making the request which
      in this case is the device_secret issued to the device of the
      native application making the request.  The device_secret MUST be
      presented per the definition of the urn:x-oath:params:oauth:token-
      type:device-secret token identifier described below.

   actor_token_type
      REQUIRED.  This value MUST be: urn:x-oath:params:oauth:token-
      type:device-secret

   scope
      OPTIONAL.  The scopes required by the requesting native
      application.

                          Mobile App Native SSO            November 2022


   requested_token_type
      OPTIONAL.  The desired token(s) to be returned.  If no
      requested_token_type is defined, it is up to the AS to return the
      appropriate tokens for the requesting client.  The full set of
      possible requested_token_type value is out of scope for this
      specification.

   This profile also defines the following token type identifiers.

   urn:x-oath:params:oauth:token-type:device-secret
      This token type identifier is used to describe the device_secret
      specified in the actor_token parameter.

4.2.  Token Exchange Request

   When a mobile app wants to request native SSO (i.e. obtain refresh
   and access tokens for an already signed in user) it makes a standard
   OAuth2 /token endpoint request following the profile for Token
   Exchange defined above.

   The following is a non-normative example

    POST /token HTTP/1.1
    Host: as.example.com
    Authorization: Basic ZGZhZGYyMzUyNDU0Og
    ...
    grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Atoken-exchange
    &audience=https%3A%3F%3Flogin.example.net&subject_token=<id_token>
    &subject_token_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Atoken-type%3Aid-token
    &actor_token=95twdf3w4y6wvftw35634t
    &actor_token_type=urn%3Ax-oath%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Atoken-type%3Adevice-secret

   The client_id in this request is sent via the HTTP Basic
   Authentication method using the HTTP Authorization header.

4.3.  Native SSO Processing Rules

   When the authorization server receives a request at the token
   endpoint conforming to this profile it MUST perform the following
   checks before issuing any tokens.

   1.  Validate the device_secret to ensure the token is still valid.
       The format of this secret is defined by the Authorization server
       and is out of scope for this specification.

   2.  Verify the id_token for integrity protection by validating the
       signature of the id_token JWT.

                          Mobile App Native SSO            November 2022


   3.  Verify that the binding between the id_token and the
       device_secret (as defined in the extension to the /token
       response) is valid.

   4.  Verify that the session id in the id_token (sid claim) is still
       valid.  If the session is no longer valid, the AS MUST return an
       error of invalid_grant.  Note that in the case of a
       refresh_tokens issued with an offline_scope the 'sid' value
       SHOULD represent the offline "session" such that if the original
       refresh_token is revoked the 'ds_hash' value in the id_token is
       no longer valid.

   5.  Validate that the client requesting native SSO is authorized to
       do so.  The AS SHOULD maintain a list of client_ids that can
       share user authentications.  For example, the AS MAY take the
       'aud' claim from the id_token and the client_id from the token
       request and ensures that both client_ids are allowed to share
       user authentications.

   6.  The AS SHOULD verify that the scopes requested by the client in
       the token request (either default scopes or explicitly specified
       in the optional scope parameter) do NOT require explicit user
       consent.  If any requested scopes require explicit user consent
       the AS SHOULD fail the request and return an error of
       invalid_scope.

   Based on the AS definition of the device_secret, the AS may perform
   additional checks to ensure the security of the request.  Provided
   the above criteria is met, the AS will issue a normal Token Response
   object containing a refresh_token, access_token and id_token issued
   to the client_id of the mobile app making the request.  The session
   associated with the new refresh_token SHOULD be the same as that used
   to verify the validity of the SSO exchange.  If that session expires,
   all refresh_tokens associated with it MUST be invalidated.

4.4.  Token Exchange Response

   The Token Exchange response for this profile has the following
   characteristics:

   access_token
      REQUIRED.  This response field contains the access token issued to
      the mobile client identified by the client_id sent in the
      Authorization header.

   issued_token_type
      REQUIRED.  This value of this parameter MUST be:
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token

   token_type
      REQUIRED.  The value of this parameter MUST be bearer.

   expires_in
      RECOMMENDED.  Identifies when the access_token expires.

   scope
      OPTIONAL.  Follows the token exchange spec definition.

   refresh_token
      OPTIONAL.  By default the AS should return a refresh_token that
      the mobile app can use to obtain additional access_tokens when the
      access_token expires.

   id_token
      OPTIONAL.  By default the AS should return an id_token that
      provides the mobile app with an identity assertion about the user.

   device_secret
      OPTIONAL.  The AS MAY return an updated device_secret in the
      response.

   In the case of any errors, the AS MUST return a valid OAuth2 Error
   response as described in Section 2.2.2 of the Token Exchange spec.

   The following is a non-normative example

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    Cache-Control: no-store

    {
      "access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
      "issued_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token",
      "token_type":"Bearer",
      "expires_in":3600,
      "refresh_token":"tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA",
      "id_token":"<id_token>",
      "device_secret":"casdfgarfgasdfg"
    }

5.1.  Device Secret Protection

   Sufficient care must be made to protect the device_secret.  The
   device secret SHOULD be encrypted by the Authorization Service and
   periodically refreshed via the mechanisms described in this
   specification.

5.2.  Cross-Device SSO

   If it is possible to move correctly bound device_secret and id_token
   to a separate device, that device can obtain the user's
   authentication state on the new device.  An implementation of this
   specification SHOULD use best efforts to bind the device_secret to
   the device instance.

5.3.  id_token usage

   Use of the id_token in this specification takes some liberties with
   id_token validation.  For instance, the aud claim normally identifies
   the client receiving the id_token and not the authorization server
   that issued the id_token.  Additionally, the id_token may have
   expired at the time of use designated by the specification.
