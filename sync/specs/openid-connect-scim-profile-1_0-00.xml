    <section title="Using SCIM">
      
        <t>When using SCIM, the relying party MAY use all the protocol features
        of SCIM and act as a SCIM client. A relying party MAY
        query SCIM configuration endpoints such as:<list>
          <t><spanx>/ServiceProviderConfig</spanx></t>
          <t><spanx>/ResourceTypes</spanx></t>
          <t><spanx>/Schemas</spanx></t>
        </list></t>
      
      <t>The OpenID Connect profile for SCIM provides two ways for a
      relying party to construct a SCIM URI for the authenticated subject: 
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>The relying party MAY use the previously discovered 
        <spanx style="verb">scim_endpoint</spanx> plus the path 
        <spanx style="verb">/Me</spanx> as a URI alias (see Section 
        3.11 of <xref target="RFC7644"/>). Or,</t>
        
        <t>The relying party MAY use the URI returned in the <spanx style="verb">scim_resource</spanx> 
        ID_Token claim provided.</t>
      </list></t>
      
      <t>
      When accessing the SCIM endpoint, the relying party SHOULD use the 
      access token issued in the response from the OP as its authorization
      to access the SCIM endpoint as per section 2 of 
      <xref target="RFC6750">OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage</xref>.
      </t>
      
      <t>OpenID Connect relying parties MAY use <spanx style="verb">scope</spanx>
      values to request authorization as per Section 5.4 <xref target="OpenID.Core"/>.
      The values used in OpenID Connect SHALL be ignored for the purpose
      of authorizing access to SCIM. These include:<list style="symbols">
        <t>openid</t>
        <t>profile</t>
        <t>email</t>
        <t>address</t>
        <t>phone</t>
      </list>These scopes SHALL continue to be used as defined by OpenID 
      Connect Core. For example, as a list of claims to be included in the ID_Token.
      </t>
      
      <t>OpenID Connect Providers offering SCIM profile services MAY support 
      SCIM specific scopes not defined in this specification. OpenID Connect
      Providers MAY also use registration data to determine the appropriate
      scope of authorization for the purpose of access to the SCIM endpoint.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">

	Section 5 of <xref target="RFC6750">OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage</xref>.
	Furthermore, the <xref target="RFC6819">OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security
	Considerations</xref> specification provides an extensive list of threats and controls 
	that apply to this specification as well,
	given that it is based upon OAuth 2.0.
	<xref target="ISO29115">ISO/IEC 29115</xref> 
	also provides threats and controls that 
	implementers need to take into account. 
	Implementers are highly advised to
	read these references in detail and apply the countermeasures described therein.

    </section>
    
    <section anchor="Privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">

      <section anchor="PII" title="Personally Identifiable Information">

	<t>The SCIM service providers typically contain Personally Identifiable
	Information (PII). As such, End-User consent for the release of the information
	for the specified purpose should be obtained at or prior to the
	authorization time in accordance with relevant regulations. The purpose
	of use is typically registered in association with the <spanx
	style="verb">redirect_uris</spanx>.</t>

	<t>Only necessary UserInfo data should be stored at the Client and the
	Client SHOULD associate the received data with the purpose of use
	statement.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="AccessMonitoring" title="Data Access Monitoring">
	<t>
	  The SCIM Resource Server SHOULD make End-Users' resource access logs
	  available to them so that they can monitor who accessed their data.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="Correlation" title="Correlation">
	<t>To protect the End-User from a possible correlation among Clients, the
	use of a Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID) as the
	<spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> (subject) SHOULD be considered.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="OfflineAccessPrivacy" title="Offline Access">

	<t>
	  Offline access enables access to Claims when the user is not present,
	  posing greater privacy risk than the Claims transfer when the user is present.
	  Therefore, it is prudent to obtain explicit consent for
	  offline access to resources.
	  This specification mandates the use of the <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx>
	  parameter to obtain consent unless it is already known that the
	  request complies with the conditions for processing the request in each jurisdiction.
	</t>
	<t>
	  When an Access Token is returned via the User Agent
	  using the Implicit Flow or Hybrid Flow, there is
	  a greater risk of it being exposed to an attacker, who could
	  later use it to access the UserInfo endpoint.
	  If the Access Token does not enable offline access and the server
	  can differentiate whether the Client request has been made
	  offline or online, the risk will be substantially reduced.
	  Therefore, this specification mandates ignoring
	  the offline access request when the Access Token is
	  transmitted through the User Agent.
	  Note that differentiating between online and offline access
	  from the server can be difficult especially for native clients.
	  The server may well have to rely on heuristics.
	  Also, the risk of exposure for the Access Token delivered
	  through the User Agent for the Response Types of
	  <spanx style="verb">code&nbsp;token</spanx> and
	  <spanx style="verb">token</spanx> is the same.
	  Thus, the implementations should be prepared to detect
	  whether the Access Token was issued through the User Agent
	  or directly from the Token Endpoint and deny offline access
	  if the token was issued through the User Agent.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Note that although these provisions require an explicit
	  consent dialogue through the <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx> parameter,
	  the mere fact that the user pressed an "accept" button etc.,
	  might not constitute a valid consent.
	  Developers should be aware that for the act of consent to
	  be valid, typically, the impact of the terms have to be
	  understood by the End-User, the consent must be freely given
	  and not forced (i.e., other options have to be available),
	  and the terms must fair and equitable.
	  In general, it is advisable for the service to follow the
	  required privacy principles in each jurisdiction and rely on
	  other conditions for processing the request than simply explicit consent,
	  as online self-service "explicit consent" often does not
	  form a valid consent in some jurisdictions.
