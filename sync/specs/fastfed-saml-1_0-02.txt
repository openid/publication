                     FastFed Basic SAML Profile 1.0           March 2020


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines the functionality which a provider must
   implement to satisfy the Basic SAMLProfile for FastFed.

   It consists of the following extensions to the FastFed Core
   [FastFed.Core] specification:

   o  Additional metadata in the FastFed Handshake Flows to exchange
      SAML Metadata URLs.

   o  Mapping rules for generating SAML Attributes from a SCIM 2.0
      schema.

   o  An interoperability profile describing the subset of the SAML
      specifications which must be implemented in order to be FastFed
      Compatible.

   o  The mechanics of certifcate rotation for SAML.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   In the .txt version of this specification, values are quoted to
   indicate that they are to be taken literally.  When using these
   values in protocol messages, the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of
   the value.  In the HTML version of this specification, values to be
   taken literally are indicated by the use of "this fixed-width font".

1.2.  Terminology

   This FastFed Profile uses the terminology defined in Section 1.2 of
   the FastFed Core [FastFed.Core] specification.

2.  Overview

   When using the SAML protocol, the FastFed Identity Provider and
   Application Provider have various responsibilities to comply with the
   protocol.

   The Identity Provider fulfills the role of a SAML Identity Provider.
   It has a responsibility to host a SAML Metadata file as described in
   Section 5.1.

                     FastFed Basic SAML Profile 1.0           March 2020


   The Application Provider fulfills the role of a SAML Application
   Provider.  It has a responsibility to host a SAML Metadata file as
   described in Section 5.2

   This specification extends the FastFed Core [FastFed.Core] handshake
   messages with the additional attributes necessary for each party to
   fulfill their respective obligations under SAML.

3.  Protocol Extensions

3.1.  FastFed Metadata

3.1.1.  Authentication Profile URN

   This specification extends the FastFed Core [FastFed.Core] Provider
   Metadata (Section 3.3.1) with the following value for
   "authentication_profiles":

   urn:ietf:params:fastfed:1.0:authentication:saml:2.0:basic  A Provider
      who includes this URN in their list of capabilities MUST comply
      with the requirements described in this specification.

   The following is a non-normative example of Provider Metadata showing
   the usage of the value:

 {
   "application_provider": {
     "capabilities": {
       "authentication_profiles": ["urn:ietf:params:fastfed:1.0:authentication:saml:2.0:basic"],
   ...
 }

3.1.2.  Application Metadata

   This specification extends the Application Provider Metadata defined
   in Section 3.3.8 of FastFed Core [FastFed.Core] with an additional
   member having the name:
   ""urn:ietf:params:fastfed:1.0:authentication:saml:2.0:basic"".

   The value of the element is a structure containing the following
   members:

   desired_attributes  REQUIRED.  A structure specifying the attributes
      to be provisioned, as described in Section 3.3.5 of FastFed Core
      [FastFed.Core].

                     FastFed Basic SAML Profile 1.0           March 2020


      When using this profile, the Application Provider MUST include the
      SCIM Core User attribute "userName" in the list of
      "required_user_attributes".

      The Application Provider MAY include additional attributes if a
      mapping exists in the table in Section 4.1.2.  If a mapping does
      not exist, the attribute MUST NOT be included in the desired
      attributes.

      Provisioning of Groups is not supported via SAML.  Therefore, the
      following MUST be omitted from the desired attributes:

      *  "required_group_attributes"

      *  "optional_group_attributes"

   The following is a non-normative example of Application Provider
   Metadata with the profile extensions:

3.2.  FastFed Handshake

3.2.1.  FastFed Registration Request

   This specification extends the JWT contents of the FastFed
   Registration Request (Section 7.2.3.1 of FastFed Core [FastFed.Core])
   with an additional member sharing the same name as the profile:
   ""urn:ietf:params:fastfed:1.0:authentication:saml:2.0:basic"".

   The value of the element is a structure with the following members:

   saml_metadata_uri  REQUIRED.  Contains the URL of the Identity
      Provider's SAML Metadata document.

   The following is a non-normative example of the contents of a
   registration request message prior to serialization:

 {
   "iss": "https://tenant-12345.idp.example.com",
   "aud": "https://tenant-67890.app.example.com",
   "exp": 1234567890,
   "schema_grammar": "urn:ietf:params:fastfed:1:0:schemas:scim:2.0",
   "authentication_profiles": [

     "saml_metatadata_uri": "https://tenant-12345.idp.example.com/saml-metadata.xml",
   }
 }

3.2.2.  FastFed Registration Response

   This specification extends the contents of the FastFed Registration
   Response (Section 7.2.3.3 of FastFed Core [FastFed.Core]) with an
   additional member sharing the same name as the profile:
   ""urn:ietf:params:fastfed:1.0:authentication:saml:2.0:basic"".

   The value of the element is a structure with the following members:

   saml_metadata_uri  REQUIRED.  Contains the URL of the Application
      Provider's SAML Metadata document.

   saml_response_attributes  OPTIONAL.  A list of Attribute References
      (Section 3.3.4 of FastFed Core [FastFed.Core]) defining the user
      attributes to be included in the SAML response.  See Section 4.1.2
      for details.

   registration response message:

 {
   "urn:ietf:params:fastfed:1.0:authentication:saml:2.0:basic": {

     "saml_response_attributes": [
       "displayName",
       "emails[primary eq true].value"
     ]
   }
 }

4.  Schema Binding

   FastFed recommmends SCIM for user schemas.  However, neither SAML nor
   SCIM specify how to represent SCIM attributes in the context of SAML
   assertions.

   This specification fills the gap and defines how FastFed compatible
   Providers can use the SCIM 2.0 Schema Grammar (Section 3.3.4.1 of
   FastFed Core [FastFed.Core]) with the SAML 2.0 protocol.

4.1.  SCIM-to-SAML Attribute Mapping

4.1.1.  SAML Subject

   A SAML document contains a "Subject" element which identifies the
   authenticated user.

   The "Subject" element MUST contain a "NameID" with the following
   properties:

   o  A "Format" set to ""urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-
      format:persistent""

   o  A value populated with the SCIM "userName".

   The following is a non-normative example of a SAML Subject:

 <saml:Subject>
   <saml:NameID Format="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent">babs@example.com</saml:NameID>
 </saml:Subject>

4.1.2.  SAML Attributes

   If users have been pre-provisioned into the Application through
   mechanisms such as SCIM, the SAML Subject alone can be sufficient to
   correlate the incoming SAML message with the appropriate pre-existing
   user.  However, there can be circumstances when additional user
   attributes are necessary.

   One such situation occurs when an application is using Just-In-Time
   provisioning instead of pre-provisioning.  In this mode of behavior,
   the incoming user attributes are used to auto-instantiate a user in
   the Application.

   To support these scenarios, FastFed allows a subset of user
   attributes to be included in SAML response messages according to the
   mapping rules below.  Any attributes not in the mapping table are
   only accessible via SCIM provisioning and cannot be included in SAML
   response messages.

   Attributes are requested by populating the member
   ""desired_attributes"" in the Application Provider Metadata
   (Section 3.1.2).

   If attributes are requested, and values exist for the user, then the
   Identity Provider MUST include SAML Attribute elements in the
   response message with the following properties:

   o  "Name" set to the value in the mapping table below.

   o  "NameFormat" set to ""urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-
      format:unspecified"".

   o  "AttributeValue" element with "xsi:type="xs:string"" and the value
      from the SCIM object according to the mapping table below.

   Note: In the table below, SCIM attributes refer to the "User"
   Resource Schema defined in Section 4.1 of the SCIM Core Specification
   [RFC7643].  Individual members of a JSON structure are referenced in
   the table using the JSON path syntax defined in Section 3.5.2 of the
   SCIM Protocol [RFC7644].

4.2.  Privacy Considerations

   When exposing user information through SAML Attributes, FastFed
   Identity Providers MUST NOT expose any attributes which were not in
   the "desired_attributes" element of the Application Provider Metadata
   (Section 3.1.2).

5.  Interoperability Requirements

   Each identity standard defines a set of optional features to enable
   usage in a wide variety of circumstances.

   However, a consequence of the flexibility is that two Providers may
   find themselves incompabitible despite sharing the same protocols.

   To deliver the simplified experience that is the goal of FastFed, it
   is important that two FastFed-enabled Providers have confidence that
   they can interoperate when sharing the same protocols.

   The following sections describe the subset of the SAML specifications
   that Providers MUST implement to be compatible with this profile.
   Providers MAY support additional functionality, but MUST NOT require
   the additional functionality when configuring federation with another
   Provider using FastFed specifications.

5.1.  Identity Provider Requirements

   o  MUST implement the required functionality of a SAML Identity
      Provider as defined in the SAML Web Browser SSO Profile
      (Section 4.1 of [SAML.Profiles]).

   o  MUST use the HTTP POST bindings for the authentication response of
      the Web Browswer SSO Profile.

   o  MUST use X509 Certificates for the Signature elements within the
      SAML Response object.

   o  MUST include a Signature element for the Assertion in the SAML
      Response, and in addition, MAY include a Signature element for the
      overall Response.

   o  The minimum algorithm stregth for the Signature elements SHOULD be
      SHA-256 for the hash digest, and either RSA with 2048 bit keys, or
      ECDSA with Curve P-256, for the signature.

   o  MUST include a "Conditions" element on the Assertion with
      NotBefore and NotOnOrAfter properties that constrain the validity
      period of the Assertion to the shortest feasible duration.  As a

      reference to implementors, a 10 minute window is often sufficient
      to reduce the risk of replays while still allowing a small degree
      of clock skew between participants.

   o  MUST host a SAML Metadata document at the location specified by
      the "saml_metadata_uri" exchanged during the FastFed Handshake.

   o  MUST include an IDPSSODescriptor element in the SAML Metadata
      document as specified in [SAML.Metadata].

   o  MUST populate the IDPSSODescriptor element with all values needed
      by a SAML Service Provider to integrate with this SAML Identity
      Provider using the capabilities described in this section.

5.2.  Application Provider Requirements

   SAML Requirements for Application Providers:

   o  MUST implement the required functionality of a SAML Service
      Provider as defined in the SAML Web Browser SSO Profile
      (Section 4.1 of [SAML.Profiles]).

   o  MUST use the HTTP Redirect binding for the authentication request
      of the Web Browswer SSO Profile.

   o  MUST accept X509 Certificates for the Signature elements
      containined within the SAML Response object.

   o  SHOULD support Signature elements generated using the SHA-256
      algorithm for the hash digest, and either RSA with 2048 bit keys,
      or ECDSA with Curve P-256, for the signature.

   o  MUST host a SAML Metadata document at the location specified by
      the "saml_metadata_uri" exchanged during the FastFed Handshake.

   o  MUST include an SPSSODescriptor element in the SAML Metadata
      document as specified in [SAML.Metadata].

   o  MUST populate the SPSSODescriptor with all values needed by a SAML
      Identity Provider to integrate with this SAML Service Provider
      using the capabilities described in this section.

   o  MAY use the information in the Identity Provider's corresponding
      SAML Metadata document to decide whether to use additional SAML
      capabilities, above and beyond the FastFed minimum interoperablity
      requirements.  The additional capabilities must be optional and
      the federation MUST still succeed if one Provider does not support
      the additional capabilities.

5.3.  Login Hint

   The Application Provider MAY include the URL-encoded query parameter
   "LoginHint={hint}" when initiating an authentication request via the
   SAML HTTP Redirect binding.

   The value is a hint to the Identity Provider about the login
   identifier the end-user might use to log in.  This hint can be known
   to the Application Provider, for example, if it first asks the end-
   user for their e-mail address (or other identifier) in order to
   discover the authentication provider to be used for sign-in.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the hint value match the value used for discovery.

   The use of this parameter is left to the Identity Provider's
   discretion.

   The LoginHint MUST NOT be included in request signature for the HTTP
   Redirect Binding.

   The Identity Provider MUST ignore the LoginHint parameter if the SAML
   Authentication Request message contains a "Subject" with an
   identifier.

   The following is a non-normative example of a SAML HTTP Redirect
   request with a LoginHint:

 HTTP/1.1 302 Found
 Location http://idp.example.com/SAML?LoginHint=bjensen%40example.org&SAMLRequest=[...omitted for brevity...]

5.4.  Certificate Rotation

   While the full SAML specification supports a variety of key types,
   the FastFed Profile defined herein restricts Providers to only X509
   Keys for signing SAML Assertions in Web Browser SSO response messages
   from the Identity Provider.

   FastFed Providers MUST implement automatic rotation of the X509
   Certificates.  This section describes the interoperability
   requirements for certificate rotation.

5.4.1.  Certificate Rotation Requirements for an Identity Provider

   To rotate and publish new SAML signing certificates, the following
   requirements apply to the Identity Provider:

   o  MUST include new certificates in the response to queries against
      the SAML Metadata URL that was exchanged during the FastFed
      Handshake.

                     FastFed Basic SAML Profile 1.0           March 2020


   o  MUST publish the new certificate in the SAML Metadata at least 14
      days before the currently active certificate will expire or be
      revoked, where the expiration date is specified by the "notAfter"
      attribute within the X.509 certificate.

   o  MUST include the new certificate in the SAML Metadata, alongside
      the currently active certificate, using the recommended technique
      for multiple certificates defined in the SAML Metadata
      Interoperability Profile [SAML.Interoperability].  As a reference,
      this Interopability Profile specifies that each certificate MUST
      be placed within its own "<KeyDescriptor>" element.

   o  SHOULD continue using the original key for signing SAML Assertions
      for at least 7 days after publishing the new certificate, to give
      consumers time to read the new certificate from the SAML Metadata
      and be ready to receive the new key.

   o  SHOULD begin signing assertions with the new key if less than 7
      days remains until the old certificate expires.  MAY continue
      using the old key if problems arise with the new key, to give time
      for diagnosis of the problems.

   o  SHOULD stop using the old key for signing assertions when less
      than 1 day remains until the old certificate expires.

   o  MUST support HTTP 1.1 ETag semantics [RFC2616] for all requests to
      the SAML Metadata URL, including:

      *  Returning an ETag response header

      *  Accepting an If-None-Match request header, and returning an
         HTTP 304 response if the SAML Metadata is unmodified.

   o  MAY return an HTTP 301 response code to indicate the SAML Metadata
      has moved to a new location.

5.4.2.  Certificate Rotation Requirements for an Application Provider

   To consume rotated SAML signing certificates, the following options
   are available to the Application Provider:

   o  MAY retrieve new keys on demand by reloading the Identity
      Provider's SAML Metadata file upon detecting a SAML authentication
      response signed with an unrecognized key.

   o  Alternatively, MAY preemptively retrieve new keys by querying the
      Identity Provider's SAML Metadata file on a recurring basis to
      check for updates.

                     FastFed Basic SAML Profile 1.0           March 2020


   When preemptively querying for updates on a recurring basis, the
   following requirements apply to the Application Provider:

   o  MUST re-query the Identity Provider's SAML Metadata URL to check
      for new certificates at least once every 24 hours.  Because
      certificates can be rotated at any time, the Application Provider
      MUST NOT wait for the expiration date to check for updated
      certificates.

   o  MUST include the If-None-Match header in the request to download
      the SAML Metadata, populated with the value of the ETag response
      header received when previously downloading the SAML Metadata.

   o  SHOULD alert the Administrator if the Identity Provider has not
      published a new certificate and less than 14 days remains until
      expiration of the current certificate.  The alert mechanism is an
      implementation detail that is outside the scope of the
      specification.

   o  MUST handle an HTTP 304 response code which indicates that the
      SAML Metadata is unchanged.

   o  SHOULD handle an HTTP 301 response code and use the new location
      for all future downloads of the Identity Provider's SAML Metadata.

   In all cases of certificate refresh, both on-demand and preemptive,
   the following requirements apply to the Application Provider:

   o  MUST support the consumption of multiple certificates using the
      recommended techniques defined in the SAML Metadata
      Interoperability Profile [SAML.Interoperability].  As a reference,
      this Interopability Profile specifies that each certificate MUST
      be placed within its own "<KeyDescriptor>" element.

   o  MUST ignore any changes in the SAML Metadata except for
      "<KeyDescriptor>" elements.

   o  MUST accept SAML assertions signed using any of the valid
      certificates specified within the "<KeyDescriptor>" elements of
      the Identity Provider SAML Metadata.
