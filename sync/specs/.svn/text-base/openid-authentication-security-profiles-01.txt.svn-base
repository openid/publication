Abstract

   This memo defines security profiles for OpenID 2.0 authentication
   protocol.  By agreeing on one or several such security profiles, an
   OpenID relying party and identity provider can decide the security
   properties for their mutual OpenID communication before such
   communication takes place.

1.  Introduction

   The OpenID Authentication 2.0 [OPENID] protocol defines a way to
   prove ownership of an identifier.  The typical use-case of this
   protocol is to log into one or several web sites without having to
   deal with multiple usernames and passswords.

   In the protocol, claims of ownership to a specific identifier have
   several security dependencies, for example cryptographic primitives,
   trust in keying material, and reliance on underlying domain system.
   This memo seeks to describe a framework for mechisms to describe such
   dependencies, as well as defining a few usable profiles.

   This memo intentionally does not advise on usage of specific
   profiles, nor does it implicitly claim to cover all security
   dependencies of the protocol, nor does it decide how to process a
   party's willing or unwilling departure from a previously agreed-upon
   profile.

2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Goals

   This security profile specification has the following goals.

   1.  Define a framework for describing profiles that security
       mechanisms with in OpenID Authentication 2.0 [OPENID].

   2.  Define a number of security profiles using this framework.

   3.  Absence or presence of these profiles MUST have no effect on the
       referenced OpenID protocol.  Compliance (and non-compliance)
       should only be governed by the protocol's parties and not the
       protocol itself.

   4.  The list of identified security variants must be extensible for
       future additions.  This is necessary to handle security risks
       that were identified after this memo was written.

   5.  Any new security variants MUST be appended to the list of
       identified variants, and not override them.  This is needed to
       keep previous defined profiles unchanged over time.  A security
       variant that should no longer be used will be marked as such in
       the current version of this memo.

5.  Non-goals

   This security profile specification has the following non-goals.

   1.  Automatic negotiation of profile.  This memo intentionally does
       not define a profile negotiation phase.

   2.  Automatic detection of profile violations.  Some security
       properties are enforceable only via cooperation of the protocol
       parties.

7.  Conventions

   It is assumed an OpenID Authentication 2.0 [OPENID] party will
   advertise its intended profile compliance via the service discovery
   phase by using the service types defined in this memo.

8.  Security variants

   The following section describes the identified security variants in
   the OpenID Authentication 2.0 [OPENID] protocol.

     This table defines the security variants and the expected values.
                References are tp the OpenID specification.

                 OpenID Authentication Security Profiles  September 2006


9.  Profiles

   The following section specifies two profiles "A" and "B" as examples.
   The identifier of these profiles are URLs that appends to
   http://openid.net/authn/2.0/.

   This memo uses names like "A" and "B" tather than"low security" and
   "medium security" as such distinctions carry implications and
   liabilities.  There is also a risk of security creep that forces
   definitions to change over time -- what is now 'medium security'
   could be 'low security' in a few years, and possibly 'useless
   security' in yet another few years.  But the definition will be stuck
   as 'medium security' forever.

9.1.  Profile A

   The identifier for this profile is http://openid.net/authn/2.0/A

       These are the profile settings as they relate to Section 9 .
