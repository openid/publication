<abstract>
<t>OpenID Connect specifies the public and pairwise subject identifier types. These types of subject identifiers allow relying parties to keep track of the End-User across multiple visits to the relying party application by correlating the subject identifier. This document specifies an ephemeral subject identifier type that prevents correlation of the subject identifier across multiple visits to enhance user privacy.</t>

<note><name>Foreword</name>
<t>The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) promotes, protects and nurtures the OpenID community and technologies. As a non-profit international standardizing body, it is comprised by over 160 participating entities (workgroup participants). The work of preparing implementer drafts and final international standards is carried out through OIDF workgroups in accordance with the OpenID Process. Participants interested in a subject for which a workgroup has been established has the right to be represented in that workgroup. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with OIDF, also take part in the work. OIDF collaborates closely with other standardizing bodies in the related fields.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>This document specifies an ephemeral subject identifier type for <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</eref>. The ephemeral subject identifier identifies the End-User for a short time and remains constant for the duration of the authentication session. In subsequent visits by the End-User to a Relying Party application that requires authentication, the authorization server will return a subject identifier with a different value. The authorization server provides an ephemeral subject identifier to the Relying Party in the ID Token and UserInfo endpoint response as specified by <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</eref>.</t>

<section anchor="terms-and-definitions"><name>Terms and definitions</name>
<t>For the purpose of this document, the terms defined in <eref target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">RFC6749</eref>, and <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</eref> apply.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="ephemeral-identifier"><name>Ephemeral Identifier</name>
<t>This document adds a new subject identifier type as follows, in addition to what is defined in Section 8 of <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</eref>:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt>ephemeral</dt>
<dd>This provides a different <em>sub</em> value to each visit by the End User to a relying party, so as not to enable Clients to correlate the End-User's multiple visits.</dd>
</dl>
</section>

<section anchor="openid-provider-discovery-metadata"><name>OpenID Provider Discovery Metadata</name>
<t>The OpenID Provider indicates support for ephemeral subject identifiers in the metadata document.</t>
<t>This document defines the following new value for the <em>subject_types_supported</em> metadata of <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html">OpenID Discovery 1.0</eref>:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><em>ephemeral</em> - ephemeral subject identifiers</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section anchor="client-registration"><name>Client Registration</name>
<t>The RP requests the OP to return ephemeral subject identifiers by registering <em>ephemeral</em> as the <em>subject_type</em> in <eref target="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html">OpenID Dynamic Registration 1.0</eref> or by other means.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security-considerations"><name>Security Considerations</name>
<t>The generated ephemeral identifier needs to be unique over time.
Otherwise, the RP may link two different users to the same record and will cause a security incident.
One way to achieve uniqueness is to use the hash of the combination of a cryptographic
random and the timestamp as the <em>sub</em> value.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="privacy-considerations"><name>Privacy Considerations</name>
<t>The privacy objectives of this document are as follows:</t>

<ol spacing="compact">
<li>to make it unfeasible for the RP to link two independent visits by the user. Inclusion of cryptographic random in the input to the hash function that generates the subject identifier would achieve it.</li>
<li>to make it unfeasible for colluding RPs to link two independent visits among them.</li>
</ol>
