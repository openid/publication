                 OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0

Abstract

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
   based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
   well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
   interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This specification defines a mechanism for a Relying Party to request
   that an OpenID Provider log out the End-User.

                 OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0   September 2022


1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749] protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the
   End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization
   Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-
   User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This specification complements the OpenID Connect Core 1.0
   [OpenID.Core] specification by enabling the Relying Party to request
   that an End-User be logged out by the OpenID Provider.

   This specification can be used separately from or in combination with
   OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 [OpenID.Session], OpenID
   Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0 [OpenID.FrontChannel], and/or OpenID
   Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0 [OpenID.BackChannel].

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   In the .txt version of this document, values are quoted to indicate
   that they are to be taken literally.  When using these values in
   protocol messages, the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.
   In the HTML version of this document, values to be taken literally
   are indicated by the use of "this fixed-width font".

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Authorization Endpoint",
   "Authorization Server", "Client", and "Client Identifier" defined by
   OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], the term "User Agent" defined by RFC 7230
   [RFC7230], and the terms defined by OpenID Connect Core 1.0
   [OpenID.Core].

   IMPORTANT NOTE TO READERS: The terminology definitions in this
   section are a normative portion of this specification, imposing
   requirements upon implementations.  All the capitalized words in the
   text of this specification, such as "Relying Party", reference these
   defined terms.  Whenever the reader encounters them, their
   definitions found in this section must be followed.

   This specification also defines the following term:

                 OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0   September 2022


2.  RP-Initiated Logout

   An RP requests that the OP log out the End-User by redirecting the
   End-User's User Agent to the OP's Logout Endpoint.  This URL is
   normally obtained via the "end_session_endpoint" element of the OP's
   Discovery response or may be learned via other mechanisms.

   This specification defines the following parameters that are used in
   the logout request at the Logout Endpoint:

   id_token_hint
      RECOMMENDED.  ID Token previously issued by the OP to the RP
      passed to the Logout Endpoint as a hint about the End-User's
      current authenticated session with the Client.  This is used as an
      indication of the identity of the End-User that the RP is
      requesting be logged out by the OP.

   logout_hint
      OPTIONAL.  Hint to the Authorization Server about the End-User
      that is logging out.  The value and meaning of this parameter is
      left up to the OP's discretion.  For instance, the value might
      contain an email address, phone number, username, or session
      identifier pertaining to the RP's session with the OP for the End-
      User.  (This parameter is intended to be analogous to the
      "login_hint" parameter defined in Section 3.1.2.1 of OpenID
      Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core] that is used in Authentication
      Requests; whereas, "logout_hint" is used in RP-Initiated Logout
      Requests.)

   client_id
      OPTIONAL.  OAuth 2.0 Client Identifier valid at the Authorization
      Server.  When both "client_id" and "id_token_hint" are present,
      the OP MUST verify that the Client Identifier matches the one used
      when issuing the ID Token.  The most common use case for this
      parameter is to specify the Client Identifier when
      "post_logout_redirect_uri" is used but "id_token_hint" is not.
      Another use is for symmetrically encrypted ID Tokens used as
      "id_token_hint" values that require the Client Identifier to be
      specified by other means, so that the ID Tokens can be decrypted
      by the OP.

   post_logout_redirect_uri
      OPTIONAL.  URI to which the RP is requesting that the End-User's
      User Agent be redirected after a logout has been performed.  This
      URI SHOULD use the "https" scheme and MAY contain port, path, and
      query parameter components; however, it MAY use the "http" scheme,
      provided that the Client Type is "confidential", as defined in
      Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], and provided the OP allows the

                 OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0   September 2022


      use of "http" RP URIs.  The URI MAY use an alternate scheme, such
      as one that is intended to identify a callback into a native
      application.  The value MUST have been previously registered with
      the OP, either using the "post_logout_redirect_uris" Registration
      parameter or via another mechanism.  An "id_token_hint" is also
      RECOMMENDED when this parameter is included.

   state
      OPTIONAL.  Opaque value used by the RP to maintain state between
      the logout request and the callback to the endpoint specified by
      the "post_logout_redirect_uri" parameter.  If included in the
      logout request, the OP passes this value back to the RP using the
      "state" parameter when redirecting the User Agent back to the RP.

   ui_locales
      OPTIONAL.  End-User's preferred languages and scripts for the user
      interface, represented as a space-separated list of BCP47
      [RFC5646] language tag values, ordered by preference.  For
      instance, the value "fr-CA fr en" represents a preference for
      French as spoken in Canada, then French (without a region
      designation), followed by English (without a region designation).
      An error SHOULD NOT result if some or all of the requested locales
      are not supported by the OpenID Provider.

   OpenID Providers MUST support the use of the HTTP "GET" and "POST"
   methods defined in RFC 7231 [RFC7231] at the Logout Endpoint.  RPs
   MAY use the HTTP "GET" or "POST" methods to send the logout request
   to the OP.  If using the HTTP "GET" method, the request parameters
   are serialized using URI Query String Serialization.  If using the
   HTTP "POST" method, the request parameters are serialized using Form
   Serialization.

   When an "id_token_hint" parameter is present, the OP MUST validate
   that it was the issuer of the ID Token.  The OP SHOULD accept ID
   Tokens when the RP identified by the ID Token's "aud" claim and/or
   "sid" claim has a current session or had a recent session at the OP,
   even when the "exp" time has passed.  If the ID Token's "sid" claim
   does not correspond to the RP's current session or a recent session
   at the OP, the OP SHOULD treat the logout request as suspect, and MAY
   decline to act upon it.

   At the Logout Endpoint, the OP SHOULD ask the End-User whether to log
   out of the OP as well.  Furthermore, the OP MUST ask the End-User
   this question if an "id_token_hint" was not provided or if the
   supplied ID Token does not belong to the current OP session with the
   RP and/or currently logged in End-User.  If the End-User says "yes",
   then the OP MUST log out the End-User.

                 OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0   September 2022


   As part of the OP logging out the End-User, the OP uses the logout
   mechanism(s) registered by the RPs to notify any RPs logged in as
   that End-User that they are to likewise log out the End-User.  RPs
   can use any of OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0
   [OpenID.Session], OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0
   [OpenID.FrontChannel], and/or OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0
   [OpenID.BackChannel] to receive logout notifications from the OP,
   depending upon which of these mechanisms the OP and RPs mutually
   support.  The RP initiating the logout is to be included in these
   notifications before the post-logout redirection defined in Section 3
   is performed.

   It is up to the RP whether to locally log out the End-User before
   redirecting the User Agent to the OP's Logout Endpoint.  On one hand,
   if the End-User approves the logout at the OP, the RP initiating the
   logout should receive a logout message from the OP and can perform a
   local logout at that time.  On the other hand, some logout
   notification methods from the OP to the RP are unreliable and
   therefore the notification might not be received.  Also, the End-User
   might not approve the OP logging out, in which case the RP would not
   receive a logout notification.

2.1.  OpenID Provider Discovery Metadata

   To support OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout, the RP needs to obtain
   the RP-Initiated Logout related OP metadata.  This OP metadata is
   normally obtained via the OP's Discovery response, as described in
   OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 [OpenID.Discovery], or MAY be learned
   via other mechanisms.

   This OpenID Provider Metadata parameter MUST be included in the
   Server's discovery responses when RP-Initiated Logout and Discovery
   are supported:

   end_session_endpoint
      REQUIRED.  URL at the OP to which an RP can perform a redirect to
      request that the End-User be logged out at the OP.  This URL MUST
      use the "https" scheme and MAY contain port, path, and query
      parameter components.

                 OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0   September 2022


3.  Redirection to RP After Logout

   In some cases, the RP will request that the End-User's User Agent to
   be redirected back to the RP after a logout has been performed.
   Post-logout redirection is only done when the logout is RP-initiated,
   in which case the redirection target is the
   "post_logout_redirect_uri" parameter value sent by the initiating RP.
   An "id_token_hint" carring an ID Token for the RP is also RECOMMENDED
   when requesting post-logout redirection; if it is not supplied with
   "post_logout_redirect_uri", the OP MUST NOT perform post-logout
   redirection unless the OP has other means of confirming the
   legitimacy of the post-logout redirection target.  The OP also MUST
   NOT perform post-logout redirection if the "post_logout_redirect_uri"
   value supplied does not exactly match one of the previously
   registered "post_logout_redirect_uris" values.  The post-logout
   redirection is performed after the OP has finished notifying the RPs
   that logged in with the OP for that End-User that they are to log out
   the End-User.

   This specification defines this Dynamic Registration parameter for
   this purpose, per Section 2.1 of OpenID Connect Dynamic Client
   Registration 1.0 [OpenID.Registration].

3.1.  Client Registration Metadata

   This Client Metadata parameter MAY be included in the Client's
   Registration information when RP-Initiated Logout and Dynamic
   Registration are supported:

   post_logout_redirect_uris
      OPTIONAL.  Array of URLs supplied by the RP to which it MAY
      request that the End-User's User Agent be redirected using the
      "post_logout_redirect_uri" parameter after a logout has been
      performed.  These URLs SHOULD use the "https" scheme and MAY
      contain port, path, and query parameter components; however, they
      MAY use the "http" scheme, provided that the Client Type is
      "confidential", as defined in Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749],
      and provided the OP allows the use of "http" RP URIs.

4.  Validation and Error Handling

   If any of the validation procedures defined in this specification
   fail, any operations requiring the information that failed to
   correctly validate MUST be aborted and the information that failed to
   validate MUST NOT be used.  Note that because RP-Initiated Logout
   Requests are intended to be idempotent, it is explicitly not an error
   for an RP to request that a logout be performed when the OP does not
   consider that the End-User is logged in with the OP at the requesting
   RP.

   As described in Section 3, when the OP detects errors in the RP-
   Initiated Logout request, the OP MUST not perform post-logout
   redirection to an RP.  Beyond that, the OP has discretion on what
   information to display to the End-User in the resulting page at the
   OP and what actions to enable the End-User to perform next.  It MAY
   display an error message.  It MAY ask the End-User whether to log out
   of the OP.

   Note that giving the End-User the opportunity to log out may have
   security benefits, especially in kiosk scenarios.  The End-User
   initiating a logout action at the RP may expect to be completely
   logged out, including from the OP.  Not giving the End-User the
   opportunity to log out at the OP and leaving the End-User logged in
   would likely violate the End-User's security expectations about being
   completely logged out.

5.  Implementation Considerations

   This specification defines features used by both Relying Parties and
   OpenID Providers that choose to implement RP-Initiated Logout.  All
   of these Relying Parties and OpenID Providers MUST implement the
   features that are listed in this specification as being "REQUIRED" or
   are described with a "MUST".  No other implementation considerations
   for implementations of RP-Initiated Logout are defined by this
   specification.

                 OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0   September 2022


6.  Security Considerations

   Logout requests without a valid "id_token_hint" value are a potential
   means of denial of service; therefore, OPs should obtain explicit
   confirmation from the End-User before acting upon them.
