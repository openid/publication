Abstract

   The OAuth 2.0 protocol framework defines a mechanism to allow a
   resource owner to delegate access to a protected resource for a
   client application.

   This specification profiles the OAuth 2.0 protocol framework to
   increase baseline security, provide greater interoperability, and
   structure deployments in a manner specifically applicable, but not
   limited to consumer-to-government deployments.

1.  Introduction

   This document profiles the OAuth 2.0 web authorization framework for
   use in the context of securing web-facing application programming
   interfaces (APIs), particularly Representational State Transfer
   (RESTful) APIs.  The OAuth 2.0 specifications accommodate a wide
   range of implementations with varying security and usability
   considerations, across different types of software clients.  The
   OAuth 2.0 client, protected resource, and authorization server
   profiles defined in this document serve two purposes:

   1.  Define a mandatory baseline set of security controls suitable for
       a wide range of government use cases, while maintaining
       reasonable ease of implementation and functionality

   2.  Identify optional, advanced security controls for sensitive use
       cases where increased risk justifies more stringent controls.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119] .

   All uses of JSON Web Signature (JWS) [RFC7515] and JSON Web
   Encryption (JWE) [RFC7516] data structures in this specification
   utilize the JWS Compact Serialization or the JWE Compact
   Serialization; the JWS JSON Serialization and the JWE JSON
   Serialization are not used.

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Authorization
   Code", "Authorization Endpoint", "Authorization Grant",
   "Authorization Server", "Client", "Client Authentication", "Client
   Identifier", "Client Secret", "Grant Type", "Protected Resource",
   "Redirection URI", "Refresh Token", "Resource Owner", "Resource
   Server", "Response Type", and "Token Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749] , the terms "Claim Name", "Claim Value", and "JSON Web
   Token (JWT)" defined by JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519] , and the
   terms defined by OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core] .

1.3.  Conformance

   This specification defines requirements for the following components:

   *  OAuth 2.0 clients.

   *  OAuth 2.0 authorization servers.

   *  OAuth 2.0 protected resources.

   The specification also defines features for interaction between these
   components:

   *  Client to authorization server.

   *  Protected resource to authorization server.

   When an iGov-compliant component is interacting with other iGov-
   compliant components, in any valid combination, all components MUST
   fully conform to the features and requirements of this specification.
   All interaction with non-iGov components is outside the scope of this
   specification.

                             iGov OAuth 2.0                   April 2025


   An iGov-compliant OAuth 2.0 authorization server MUST support all
   features as described in this specification.  A general-purpose
   authorization server MAY support additional features for use with
   non-iGov clients and protected resources.

   An iGov-compliant OAuth 2.0 client MUST use all functions as
   described in this specification.  A general-purpose client library
   MAY support additional features for use with non-iGov authorization
   servers and protected resources.

   An iGov-compliant OAuth 2.0 protected resource MUST use all functions
   as described in this specification.  A general-purpose protected
   resource library MAY support additional features for use with non-
   iGov authorization servers and clients.

1.4.  Global Requirements

   All network connections MUST be made using TLS 1.3 or above.  Each
   originator of a TLS connection MUST verify the destination's
   certificate.  Additionally, the following four TLS 1.2 cipher suites
   MAY be used:

      TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256

      TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

      TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256

      TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

   Implementers of this profile SHOULD monitor the progress of
   specifications of post-quantum cryptography for TLS implementations.
   Implementers MAY adopt a cipher suite not included in BCP195 [BCP195]
   when post quantum safety is required if the cipher suite is supported
   in the implementation environment.

   An example of an emerging PQ cipher suite that is broadly supported
   at the time of writing is X25519MLKEM768, specified by Post-quantum
   Hybrid Key Exchange with ML-KEM in the Internet Key Exchange Protocol
   Version 2 (IKEv2) [mlkem.ikev2].

   For the authorization_endpoint, the authorization server MAY allow
   additional cipher suites that are permitted by the latest version of
   BCP195 [BCP195], if necessary to allow sufficient interoperability
   with users' web browsers or as required by local regulations.

   NOTE: Permitted cipher suites are those listed in BCP195 [BCP195]
   that do not explicitly say MUST NOT use.

   Endpoints for use by web browsers MUST use mechanisms to ensure that
   connections cannot be downgraded using TLS Stripping attacks.
   Protected resources MAY implement an HTTP Strict Transport Security
   policy as defined in HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) [RFC6797]
   to mitigate these attacks.  Protected resources SHOULD consider
   registering web domain names with browsers that offer browser-side
   ("preload") HSTS policy enforcement to further mitigate TLS downgrade
   attacks.

2.  Client Profiles


2.1.  Client Types

   OAuth defines two client types, based on their ability to
   authenticate securely with the authorization server

   confidential clients:  Clients that have credentials with the
      authorization server.

   public clients:  Clients without credentials.

2.2.  Client Type Use Cases

   This specification has been designed around the following client use
   cases:

   web application:  A web application is a client running on a web
      server.  Resource owners access the client via an HTML user
      interface rendered in a user agent on the device used by the
      resource owner.  The client credentials as well as any access
      tokens issued to the client are stored on the web server and are
      not exposed to or accessible by the resource owner.  In this use
      case, web applications are confidential clients.

   native application:  A native application is a client installed and
      executed on the device used by the resource owner.  Protocol data
      and credentials are accessible to the resource owner.  It is
      assumed that any client authentication credentials included in the
      application can be extracted.  Dynamically issued access tokens
      and refresh tokens can receive an acceptable level of protection.
      On some platforms, these credentials are protected from other
      applications residing on the same device.  Best current practices
      for native applications are detailed in OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps
      [RFC8252].  In this use case, native applications are public
      clients.

   browser-based application:  A browser-based application is a client



Burgin & Clancy              Standards Track                    [Page 5]

                             iGov OAuth 2.0                   April 2025


      in which the client code is downloaded from a web server and
      executes within a user agent (e.g., web browser) on the device
      used by the resource owner.  Protocol data and credentials are
      easily accessible (and often visible) to the resource owner.  If
      such applications wish to use client credentials, it is
      recommended to utilize the backend for frontend pattern.  Since
      such applications reside within the user agent, they can make
      seamless use of the user agent capabilities when requesting
      authorization.  This use case is out of scope due to the inherent
      lack of security provided by browser-based applications.  However,
      best current practices are detailed in OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based
      Applications [browser-based-apps].

2.3.  Client Registration

   All clients MUST register with the authorization server.  For client
   software that may be installed on multiple client instances, such as
   native applications, each client instance MAY receive a unique client
   identifier from the authorization server.

   Client registration MAY be completed by either out-of-band
   configuration or using the Dynamic Client Registration Protocol
   [RFC7591].

   If a client uses mTLS [RFC8705] for client authentication or to
   sender-constrain tokens, the client MUST include the
   tls_client_certificate_bound_access_tokens parameter in its
   registration metadata.

   If a client uses DPoP [RFC9449] to sender constrain tokens, the
   client MUST include the dpop_bound_access_tokens parameter in its
   registration metadata.

   Clients using mTLS for client authentication or to sender-constrain
   tokens MUST register their TLS certificate's subject DN with the
   authorization server.  Clients using self-signed certificate option
   are not guaranteed uniqueness of their certificate fingerprint.

2.3.1.  Redirect URI

   Clients using the authorization code grant type MUST register their
   full redirect URIs.

   Clients MUST protect the values passed back to its redirect URI by
   ensuring that the redirect URI is one of the following:

   *  Hosted on a website with Transport Layer Security (TLS) protection
      (a Hypertext Transfer Protocol - Secure (HTTPS) URI)



Burgin & Clancy              Standards Track                    [Page 6]

                             iGov OAuth 2.0                   April 2025


   *  Hosted on a client-specific non-remote-protocol URI scheme (e.g.,
      myapp://)

   Clients MUST use a unique redirect URI for each logical authorization
   server.

   Clients MUST NOT forward values passed back to their redirect URIs to
   other arbitrary or user-provided URIs (a practice known as an "open
   redirector").

   Refer to Best Current Practice for OAuth 2.0 Security [BCP240]
   Section 2.4.1 for additional guidance on implementation of edge
   cases.

2.4.  Sender-constrained Tokens

   While a bearer token can be used by anyone in possession of the
   token, a sender-constrained token is bound to a particular symmetric
   or asymmetric key issued to, or already possessed by, the client.
   The association of the key to the token is also communicated to the
   protected resource.  When the client presents the token to the
   protected resource, it is also required to demonstrate possession of
   the corresponding key.

   As described in Best Current Practice for OAuth 2.0 Security
   [BCP240], sender-constrained tokens could prevent a number of attacks
   on OAuth that entail the misuse of stolen and leaked access tokens by
   unauthorized parties.  The attacker would need to obtain the
   legitimate client's cryptographic key along with the access token to
   gain access to protected resources.

   All clients MUST use proof of possession to sender-constrain access
   tokens using either OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and
   Certificate-Bound Access Tokens [RFC8705] or OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating
   Proof of Possession (DPoP) [RFC9449].

2.5.  Authentication Context and Step-Up Authentication Challenge
      Protocol Support

   Clients MUST support the mechanism specified in OAuth 2.0 Step Up
   Authentication Challenge Protocol" [RFC9470] to communicate
   authentication context and implement interoperable step up
   authentication.

   This profile acknowledges government use cases will likely operate
   within an ecosystem of authentication methods of highly variable
   security value for the foreseeable future by imposing requirements to
   enable protected resources with basic capabilities to communicate



Burgin & Clancy              Standards Track                    [Page 7]

                             iGov OAuth 2.0                   April 2025


   requirements for authentication strength and recency to supporting
   authorization clients and servers, as well as the capability to
   enforce access policies using access tokens augmented with the
   strength and recency of the authentication event that led to the
   issuance of each specific access token.

   This profile leverages the supporting server metadata, request, token
   claims and values, and error messages from OAuth 2.0 Step Up
   Authentication Challenge Protocol [RFC9470] and OpenID Connect Core
   1.0 [OpenID.Core].

   Digital identity policies and semantic mappings to string values are
   necessary for implementation but are out of scope for this profile.

   OAuth 2.0 MUST NOT be used as an authentication protocol.  Use of the
   International Government Assurance Profile (iGov) for OpenID Connect
   1.0 [OpenID.iGov] is RECOMMENDED to provide the identity
   authentication layer for iGov OAuth 2.0 delegated access use cases.

2.6.  Connection to the Authorization Server

2.6.1.  Requests to the Authorization Endpoint

   All clients MUST use the PKCE S256 code challenge method as described
   in Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients [RFC7636] and
   include the "code_challenge" parameter and "code_challenge_method",
   set to "S256", in the authorization request.

   Clients making a request to the authorization endpoint MUST use an
   unpredictable value for the state parameter with at least 128 bits of
   entropy.  Clients MUST validate the value of the state parameter upon
   return to the redirect URI and MUST ensure that the state value is
   securely tied to the user's current session (e.g., by relating the
   state value to a session identifier issued by the client software to
   the browser).

   Clients MUST include their full redirect URI in the authorization
   request.

   The client MAY specify a strength of authentication and maximum age
   to the authorization server that should be met when issuing an access
   token for the requesting client by including parameters in the
   authorization request:

   acr_values  a space-separated string listing the authentication
      context class reference values in order of preference.  The
      protected resource requires one of these values for the
      authentication event associated with the access token.  As defined



Burgin & Clancy              Standards Track                    [Page 8]

                             iGov OAuth 2.0                   April 2025


      in Section 1.2 of OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core], the
      authentication context conveys information about how
      authentication takes place (e.g., what authentication method(s) or
      assurance level to meet).  It is out of scope of this document to
      determine how an organization semantically maps their digital
      identity practices to acr values that identify levels of
      assurance.

   max_age  a non-negative integer value that indicates the allowable
      elapsed time in seconds since the last active authentication event
      associated with the access token.

   Furthermore, if the authorization request is a follow-up to a prior
   request that did not meet the resource server's initial or subsequent
   authentication strength or recency requirements, the client should
   include the acr_values and/or max_age values sent by the resource
   server with the insuffient_user_authentication error code that
   specify expected strength and recency requirements to be provided to
   the authentication provider, such as the OpenID Provider, in a new
   authentication request.

   The following is a sample response from a client to the end user's
   browser for the purpose of redirecting the end user to the
   authorization server's authorization endpoint:

   NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

   HTTP/1.2 302 Found

   This causes the browser to send the following (non-normative) request
   to the authorization endpoint (inline wraps for display purposes
   only):

2.6.2.  Requests to the Token Endpoint

   Confidential clients MUST authenticate to the authorization server's
   token endpoint using either the private_key_jwt method as defined in
   OpenID Connect Core [OpenID.Core] or the mutually-authenticated
   transport layer security (mTLS) request method defined in OAuth 2.0
   Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens
   [RFC8705].

   If using the private_key_jwt method, the request MUST be a JWT
   assertion as defined by the JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client
   Authentication and Authorization Grants [RFC7523].  The JWT assertion
   MUST be signed by the client using the client's private key.  If
   using mTLS [RFC8705], the request MUST be made over a mutually
   authenticated TLS channel.

2.6.3.  Client Keys

   Confidential clients MUST have a public/private key pair for use in
   authentication to the token endpoint.  These clients MUST either send
   the public key directly in the jwks field or register a jwks_uri that
   is reachable by the authorization server.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   clients use a jwks_uri if possible as this allows for key rotation
   more easily.  This applies to both dynamic and out-of-band client
   registration.

   The jwks field or the content available from the jwks_uri of a client
   MUST contain a public key in JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) [RFC7517]
   format.  The authorization server MUST validate the content of the
   client's registered jwks_uri document and verify that it contains a
   JWK Set. The following example is of a 2048-bit RSA key:

2.7.1.  Requests to the Protected Resource

   Clients MUST use the authorization request header field mechanism to
   send bearer tokens as defined by [RFC6750].

   An example of an OAuth-protected call to the OpenID Connect UserInfo
   endpoint, sending the token in the Authorization header, follows:

   NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

3.  Authorization Server Profile

   All servers MUST conform to applicable recommendations found in the
   Security Considerations sections of [RFC6749] and those found in the
   OAuth Threat Model Document [RFC6819].

   The authorization server MUST protect all communications to and from
   its OAuth endpoints using TLS as described in Section 1.4.

3.1.  Connections with clients


3.1.1.  Grant types

   Authorization servers MUST support the authorization_code grant type
   and MAY support the client_credentials grant type.  The implicit
   grant type MUST NOT be used.

   Authorization servers MUST limit each registered client (identified
   by a client ID) to a single client type only, since a single piece of
   software will be functioning at runtime as only one client type.
   Clients that have multiple client types MUST have a separate client
   ID for each client type.

                             iGov OAuth 2.0                   April 2025


3.1.2.  Client authentication

   Authorization servers MUST enforce client authentication for
   confidential clients.  Public clients cannot authenticate to the
   authorization server.  The authorization server MUST support the
   RS256 signature method (the Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA)
   signature algorithm with a 256-bit hash) and MAY use other asymmetric
   signature methods listed in the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA [RFC7518])
   specification.

   The authorization server MUST validate all redirect URIs for
   authorization code grant types.

   The authorization server MUST confirm thumbprints of client keys.

   Authorization servers MUST only grant access to higher level scope
   resources to clients that have permission to request these scope
   levels.  Authorization servers MUST reject client authorization
   requests containing scopes that are outside their permission.

   Authorization servers MAY set the expiry time (exp) of access_tokens
   associated with higher level resources to be shorter than
   access_tokens for less sensitive resources.

   Authorization servers MAY allow a refresh_token issued at a higher
   level to be used to obtain an access_token for a lower level resource
   scope with an extended expiry time.  The client MUST request both the
   higher level scope and lower level scope in the original
   authorization request.  This allows clients to continue accessing
   lower level resources after the higher level resource access has
   expired -- without requiring an additional user authentication/
   authorization.

   When a client requests both a higher level scope and a lower level
   scope in the original authorization request, Authorization servers
   MAY allow refresh tokens issued at the higher level to be used to
   obtain an access_token for a lower level resource scope with an
   extended expiry time.  This allows clients to continue accessing
   lower level resources after the higher level resource access has
   expired without requiring an additional user authentication/
   authorization.

3.1.3.  Dynamic Registration

   Dynamic Registration allows for authorized Clients to on-board
   programmatically without administrative intervention.  This is
   particularly important in ecosystems with many potential Clients,
   including Mobile Apps acting as independent Clients.  Authorization
   servers MUST support dynamic client registration, and clients MAY
   register using the Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [RFC7591] for
   authorization code grant types.  Clients MUST NOT dynamically
   register for the client credentials grant type.  Authorization
   servers MAY limit the scopes available to dynamically registered
   clients.

   Authorization servers MAY protect their Dynamic Registration
   endpoints by requiring clients to present credentials that the
   authorization server would recognize as authorized participants.
   Authorization servers MAY accept signed software statements as
   described in [RFC7591] issued to client software developers from a
   trusted registration entity.  The software statement can be used to
   tie together many instances of the same client software that will be
   run, dynamically registered, and authorized separately at runtime.
   The software statement MUST include the following client metadata
   parameters:

   redirect_uris  array of redirect URIs used by the client; subject to
      the requirements listed in Section 2.3.1

   grant_types  grant type used by the client; must be
      "authorization_code" or "client_credentials"

   client_name  human-readable name of the client

   client_uri  URL of a web page containing further information about
      the client

   tls_client_certificate_bound_access_tokens  REQUIRED.  Boolean value
      indicating server support for mutual-TLS client certificate-bound
      access tokens.

   acr_values_supported  OPTIONAL.  Indicates the client will include
      the acr_values and max_age parameters in authorization requests,
      and send insufficient_user_authentication error messages in
      conformance with OAuth 2.0 Step Up Authentication Challenge
      Protocol [RFC9470].

   dpop_signing_alg_values_supported  REQUIRED.  A JSON array containing
      a list of the JWS alg values supported by the client for DPoP
      proof JWTs.



Burgin & Clancy              Standards Track                   [Page 14]

                             iGov OAuth 2.0                   April 2025


   jwks_uri or jwks  client's public key in a JWK Set [RFC7517], or if
      jwks_uri is used it MUST be reachable by the Authorization Server
      and point to the client's public key set.  If the PKI/
      tls_client_auth method is used, the public key must be issued by a
      trusted Certificate Authority.  If either the self-signed mTLS
      method or private_key_jwt method for client authentication is
      used, the jwks MUST include a certificate.

   A client using the tls_client_auth authentication method MUST use
   exactly one of the below metadata parameters to indicate the
   certificate subject value that the authorization server is to expect
   when authenticating the respective client:

   tls_client_auth_subject_dn  String value specifying the expected
      subject DN of the client certificate.

   tls_client_auth_san_dns  String value specifying the expected dNSName
      SAN entry in the client certificate.

   tls_client_auth_san_uri  String value specifying the expected
      uniformResourceIdentifier SAN entry in the client certificate.

   tls_client_auth_san_ip  String value specifying the expected
      iPAddress SAN entry in the client certificate.

   tls_client_auth_san_email  String value specifying the expected
      rfc822Name SAN entry in the client certificate.

3.1.4.  Client Approval

   When prompting the end user with an interactive approval page, the
   authorization server MUST indicate to the user:

   *  Whether the client was dynamically registered, or else statically
      registered by a trusted administrator, or a public client.

   *  Whether the client is associated with a software statement, and in
      which case provide information about the trusted issuer of the
      software statement.

   *  What kind of access the client is requesting, including scope,
      protected resources (if applicable beyond scopes), and access
      duration.

   For example, for public clients, a message indicating a new App
   installation has been registered as a client can help users determine
   if this is the expected behavior.  This signal helps users protect
   themselves from potentially rogue clients.

3.1.5.  Sender-constrained Tokens

   The authorization server MUST support and verify sender-constrained
   tokens.

   The Authorization Server MUST NOT issue the client an access token if
   the client included the tls_client_certificate_bound_access_tokens
   parameter in its registration metadata and makes a request to the
   token endpoint over connection not secured by TLS.

3.1.6.  Discovery

   The authorization server MUST provide an OpenID Connect service
   discovery [OpenID.Discovery] endpoint listing the components relevant
   to the OAuth 2.0 protocol:

   issuer  REQUIRED.  The fully qualified issuer URL of the server

   authorization_endpoint  REQUIRED.  The fully qualified URL of the
      server's authorization endpoint defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749]

   token_endpoint  REQUIRED.  The fully qualified URL of the server's
      token endpoint defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749]

   token_endpoint_auth_method  REQUIRED.  String of values corresponding
      to permitted methods for client authentication to the
      authorization server as defined in OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client
      Registration Protocol [RFC7591].  Within this profile, the server
      MUST provide one or more of the following values:
      "private_key_jwt", "tls_client_auth", and "self_signed_tls_auth".

   introspection_endpoint  OPTIONAL.  The fully qualified URL of the
      server's introspection endpoint defined by OAuth Token
      Introspection [RFC7662]

   revocation_endpoint  OPTIONAL.  The fully qualified URL of the
      server's revocation endpoint defined by OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation
      [RFC7009]

   mtls_endpoint_aliases  OPTIONAL.  A JSON object containing
      alternative authorization server endpoints that, when present, an
      OAuth client intending to perform mutual TLS uses in preference to
      the conventional endpoints.  Use of this parameter enables
      isolation of mTLS behavior to only clients intending to use mTLS
      for authentication or sender-constraining tokens.  Usage of the
      parameter is specified in OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client
      Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens [RFC8705]

   jwks_uri  REQUIRED.  The fully qualified URI of the server's JWK as
      defined in OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata [RFC8414].  If
      the self_signed_tls_auth method is used, a jwks_uri MUST be
      registered and MUST include a certificate.

   If a client uses OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and
   Certificate-Bound Access Tokens [RFC8705]S for client authentication,
   exactly one authentication method metadata value MUST be included.

   tls_client_auth  Indicates that client authentication to the
      authorization server will occur with mutual TLS utilizing the PKI
      method of associating a certificate to a client.

   self_signed_tls_client_auth  Indicates that client authentication to
      the authorization server will occur using mutual TLS with the
      client utilizing a self-signed certificate.

   If the authorization server is also an OpenID Connect Provider, it
   MUST provide a discovery endpoint meeting the requirements listed in
   Section 3.6 of OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core].

   The following example shows a JSON document found at the discovery
   endpoint for an authorization server:

   It is RECOMMENDED that authorization servers provide cache
   information through HTTP headers and make the cache valid for at
   least one week.  This allows clients and protected resources to cache
   the discovery information.

   Authorization servers MUST support the RS256 signature method (the
   Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA) signature algorithm with a 256-bit
   hash) and MAY use other asymmetric signature methods listed in the
   JSON Web Algorithms (JWA [RFC7518]) ) specification.

   The authorization server MUST provide its public key in JWK Set
   format.  The key MUST contain the following fields:

   kid  The key ID of the key pair used to sign this token

   kty  The key type

   alg  The default algorithm used for this key

   The following is an example of a 2048-bit RSA public key:

3.1.7.  Revocation

   Token revocation allows a client to signal to an authorization server
   that a given token will no longer be used.

                             iGov OAuth 2.0                   April 2025


   Authorization servers MUST provide a revocation endpoint URL as
   specified in OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation [RFC7009] for end users to
   view a list of clients that have been granted access to resources on
   the user's behalf and for end users to revoke this access.

   Authorization servers MUST revoke a token if the client requesting
   the revocation is the client to which the token was issued, the
   client has permission to revoke tokens, and the token is able to be
   revoked.

   Authorizatin servers MUST NOT allow a client to use a token after it
   is revoked.

3.1.8.  PKCE

   Authorization servers MUST require use of PKCE (Proof Key for Code
   Exchange by OAuth Public Clients [RFC7636]) by all clients and reject
   requests to the authorization endpoint from clients that do not
   contain a code challenge.

   Authorization servers MUST support the S256 code challenge method.
   Authorization servers MUST NOT allow a client to use the plain code
   challenge method.

   The PKCE code_verifier value MUST contain at least 128 bits of
   entropy.

   Authorization servers MUST confirm thumbprints of client keys.

3.1.9.  Redirect URIs

   The authorization server MUST validate all redirect URIs for
   authorization code grant types.

   To prevent open redirection and other injection attacks, the
   authorization server MUST match the entire redirect URI using an
   exact string match against registered values and MUST reject requests
   with an invalid or missing redirect URI.

3.1.10.  Refresh Tokens

   Authorization servers MAY issue refresh tokens to clients.

3.2.  Response to Authorization Requests

   Authorization servers respond to an Authorization Request from a
   client with an Authorization Response.  The following fields MUST be
   included in the response:



Burgin & Clancy              Standards Track                   [Page 20]

   state  REQUIRED.  The value of the state parameter passed in in the
      authentication request.  This value MUST match exactly.

   code  REQUIRED.  The authorization code, a random string issued by
      the IdP to be used in the request to the token endpoint.

   PKCE parameters MUST be associated with the authorization code as per
   Section 4.4 of Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients
   (PKCE) [RFC7636].

   The following is an example response:

3.3.  JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

   Authorization servers MUST issue cryptographically signed sender-
   constrained tokens in the JSON Web Token (JWT) format as defined in
   JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens [RFC9068].
   The information carried in the JWT is intended to allow a protected
   resource to quickly test the integrity of the token without
   additional network calls, and to allow the protected resource to
   determine which authorization server issued the token.  The protected
   resource MAY use the authorization server token introspection service
   to retrieve additional security information about the token.

   The server MUST issue tokens as JWTs with, at minimum, the following
   claims:

   iss  The issuer URL of the server that issued the token

   client_id  The client id of the client to whom this token was issued

   exp  The expiration time (integer number of seconds since from
      1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC), after which the token MUST be
      considered invalid

   jti  A unique JWT Token ID value with at least 128 bits of entropy.
      This value MUST NOT be re-used in another token.  Clients MUST
      check for reuse of jti values and reject all tokens issued with
      duplicate jti values.

   sub  The identifier of the end-user that authorized this client, or

      the client id of a client acting on its own behalf (such as a bulk
      transfer).  Since this information could potentially leak private
      user information, it should be used only when needed.  End-user
      identifiers SHOULD be pairwise anonymous identifiers unless the
      audience requires otherwise.

   aud  The audience of the token, an array containing the identifier(s)
      of protected resource(s) for which the token is valid, if this
      information is known.  The aud claim may contain multiple values
      if the token is valid for multiple protected resources.  Note that
      at runtime, the authorization server may not know the identifiers
      of all possible protected resources at which a token may be used.

   scope  The value of the scope claim is a JSON string containing a
      space-separated list of scopes associated with the token, in the
      format described in Section 3.3 of The OAuth 2.0 Authorization
      Framework [RFC6749].

   iat  The "iat" (issued at) claim identifies the time at which the JWT
      was issued.  This claim can be used to determine the age of the
      JWT.  Its value MUST be a number containing a NumericDate value.

   cnf  The confirmation claim, as defined in Proof-of-Possession Key
      Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) [RFC7800] and OAuth 2.0
      Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access
      Tokens [RFC8705] is used in a JWT to contain members used to
      identify the proof-of-possession key.

      When OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and
      Certificate-Bound Access Tokens [RFC8705]is used, the confirmation
      claim value MUST be computed using the X.509 Certificate SHA-256
      Thumbprint and include confirmation method value "x5t#256".

      When OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) [RFC9449]
      is used, the confirmation claim value MUST be computed using the
      JWK SHA-256 Thumbprint [RFC7638] of the DPoP public key and
      include conformation method value jkt.

   In order to support backwards compatibility, AS MAY include the azp
   claim while resource servers modernize.

   The following sample claim set illustrates the use of the required
   claims for an access token as defined in this profile; additional
   claims MAY be included in the claim set:

      }
   }

   The access tokens MUST be signed with JWS [RFC7515] . If
   private_key_jwt is used, the authorization server MUST support the
   RS256 signature method for tokens and MAY use other asymmetric
   signing methods as defined in the IANA JSON Web Signatures and
   Encryption Algorithms registry [JWS.JWE.Algs] . The JWS header MUST
   contain the following fields:

   kid  The key ID of the key pair used to sign this token

   This example access token has been signed with the server's private
   key using RS256:

   Refresh tokens SHOULD be signed with JWS [RFC7515] using the same
   private key and contain the same set of claims as the access tokens.

   The authorization server MAY encrypt access tokens and refresh tokens
   using JWE [RFC7516] . Encrypted access tokens MUST be encrypted using
   the public key of the protected resource.  Encrypted refresh tokens
   MUST be encrypted using the authorization server's public key.



Burgin & Clancy              Standards Track                   [Page 23]

                             iGov OAuth 2.0                   April 2025


   The client SHOULD use a certificate to sender-constrain tokens that
   is distinct from the certificate used to connect to the protected
   resource.

3.4.  Token Lifetimes

   Access tokens SHOULD have a valid lifetime no greater than one hour,
   and refresh tokens (if issued) SHOULD have a valid lifetime no
   greater than twenty-four hours.  Specific applications MAY issue
   tokens with different lifetimes.  Any active token MAY be revoked at
   any time.

3.5.  Scopes

   Scopes define individual pieces of authority that can be requested by
   clients, granted by resource owners, and enforced by protected
   resources.  Specific scope values will be highly dependent on the
   specific types of resources being protected in a given interface.
   OpenID Connect, for example, defines scope values to enable access to
   different attributes of user profiles.

   Authorization servers SHOULD define and document default scope values
   that will be used if an authorization request does not specify a
   requested set of scopes.

   To facilitate general use across a wide variety of protected
   resources, authorization servers SHOULD allow for the use of
   arbitrary scope values at runtime, such as allowing clients or
   protected resources to use arbitrary scope strings upon registration.
   Authorization servers MAY restrict certain scopes from use by
   dynamically registered systems or public clients.

   Refer to Section 3.1.4 for further information about displaying
   scopes to end users.

3.6.  Connections Between Authorization Servers and Protected Resources

3.6.1.  Introspection

   Token introspection allows a protected resource to query the
   authorization server for metadata about a token.  Authorization
   servers MUST NOT allow clients to use token introspection endpoints.

   The protected resource makes a request over a mutually authenticated
   TLS connection like the following to the token introspection
   endpoint:

   The client assertion parameter is structured as described in
   Section 2.6.2.

   Authorization servers respond to an introspection request with a JSON
   object containing the following fields as defined in OAuth 2.0 Token
   Introspection [RFC7662].

   active  Boolean value indicating whether or not this token is
      currently active at this authorization server.  Tokens that have
      been revoked, have expired, or were not issued by this
      authorization server are considered non-active.

   scope  Space-separated list of OAuth 2.0 scope values represented as

      a single string.

   exp  Timestamp of when this token expires (integer number of seconds
      since from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC)

   sub  An opaque string that uniquely identifies the user who
      authorized this token at this authorization server (if
      applicable).  This string MAY be diversified per client.

   client_id  An opaque string that uniquely identifies the OAuth 2.0
      client that requested this token

   The following example is a response from the introspection endpoint:

 HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    "client_id": "e71fb72a-974f-4001-bcb7-e67c2bc0037f",
    "token_type": "Bearer"
 }

   Authorization servers MUST require authentication of resource servers
   for the introspection endpoint using either private_key_jwt or
   Mutual-TLS methods as described for clients in Section 2.6.2.
   Authorization servers MUST NOT allow clients to use token
   introspection endpoints.

4.  Protected Resource Profile

4.1.  Connections with Clients

   Protected resources MUST interpret access tokens using either JWT,
   token introspection, or a combination of the two

   Protected resources MUST check the aud (audience) claim in tokens to
   ensure that it includes the protected resource's identifier.





Burgin & Clancy              Standards Track                   [Page 26]

                             iGov OAuth 2.0                   April 2025


   Protected resources MUST accept tokens passed in the authorization
   header as described in [RFC6750].  A protected resource MUST NOT
   accept tokens passed in the form parameter or query parameter
   methods.

   Protected resources MUST define and document which scopes are
   required for access to the resource and any authentication strength
   or recency requirements for each scope.

   If a client mTLS [RFC8705] to sender-constrain tokens, the protected
   resource MUST verify that the certificate matches the certificate
   associated with the access token.  If they do not match, the resource
   access attempt MUST be denied.

   Protected resources MAY use authentication context or step up
   authentication to implement access controls.

   If the authentication event associated with the access token does not
   satisfy the requirements of the resource server for the given
   request, the protected resource MUST return a 401 Unauthorized status
   code along with a WWW-Authenticate header as defined in OAuth 2.0
   Step Up Authentication Challenge Protocol [RFC9470].  This header
   MUST include the insufficient_user_authentication error code to
   indicate that the presented access token is inadequate.

   Additionally, the response MUST include the acr_values and/or max_age
   auth-params to communicate the necessary authentication context class
   reference values and the allowable elapsed time since the last active
   authentication event, respectively.  The acr_values parameter should
   list the required authentication context class reference values in
   order of preference, while the max_age parameter should indicate the
   maximum permissible time in seconds since the last user
   authentication.

   The mechanisms by which the protected resource determines whether the
   authentication requirements are met are outside the scope of this
   profile.

   Furthermore, protected resources MAY include both acr_values and
   max_age if both are relevant.

   Protected resources MAY include the scope parameter if additional
   scopes are required to access the resource, as per Section 3.1 of The
   OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750].

                             iGov OAuth 2.0                   April 2025


4.2.  Protecting Resources

4.2.1.  Trust Levels and Scopes

   Protected Resources grant access to clients if they present a valid
   sender-constrained access_token with the appropriate scopes.
   Resource servers trust the authorization server to authenticate the
   end user and client appropriately for the importance, risk, and value
   level of the protected resource scope.

   Protected resources MAY use OAuth 2.0 Step Up Authentication
   Challenge Protocol [RFC9470] to implement access controls.

   If a protected resources requires a higher end-user authentication
   trust level to access certain resources, the protected resource MUST
   associate those resources with a unique scope and MUST associate
   acceptable acr values for each scope as descibed in OAuth 2.0 Step Up
   Authentication Challenge Protocol [RFC9470].  Protected Resources may
   also specify a max_age for each scope.

   Protected resources MAY include the scope parameter if additional
   scopes are required to access the resource, as per Section 3.1 of The
   OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750].

4.2.2.  Trust Levels Example

   For example, a resource server associates scopes with data classified
   as "public" and "sensitive".  Access to data with scope "sensitive"
   requires the user to perform a two-factor authentication and limits
   those access grants to only 15 minutes.  The resource server
   associates scope "sensitive" with acr="MFA".

   For a client to obtain access to both "public" and "sensitive" data,
   it makes an authorization request to the authorization server with
   scope=public+sensitive, acr_values="MFA", and max_age=900.  The
   authorization server authenticates the end-user as required to meet
   the required trust level (two-factor authentication or some approved
   equivalent) and issues an access_token for the "public" and
   "sensitive" scopes with an expiry time of 15 minutes and a
   refresh_token for the "public" scope with an expiry time of 24 hrs.

   The client can access both "public" and "sensitive" data for 15mins
   with the access_token.  When the access_token expires, the client
   will NOT be able to access "public" or "sensitive" data any longer as
   the access_token has expired, and must obtain a new access_token.






Burgin & Clancy              Standards Track                   [Page 28]

                             iGov OAuth 2.0                   April 2025


   The client makes a refresh token request (as described in OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749] section 6) with the refresh_token, and the reduced scope of
   just "public".  The token endpoint validates the refresh_token, and
   issues a new access_token for just the "public" scope with an expiry
   time set to 24hrs.  An access grant request for a new access_token
   with the "sensitive" scope would be rejected, and require the client
   to get the end-user to re-authenticate/authorize the "sensitive"
   scope request.

   In this manner, protected resources and authorization servers work
   together to meet risk tolerance levels for sensitive resources and
   end-user authentication.

4.3.  Connections with Authorization Servers

   Protected resources MUST provide a JWKS URI endpoint to distribute
   public keys to support signing, encryption, and authentication to
   authorization server revocation and introspection endpoints.  OAuth
   2.0 Protected Resource Metadata [draft-resource-metadata] defines a
   metadata format that a client or authorization server can use to
   obtain the information needed to interact with a protected resource.
   This metadata facilitates enhanced interoperability and security,
   including advertisement and discovery of a protected resource's
   public key via its jwks_uri.

   Protected resources calling the introspection endpoint MUST use
   credentials distinct from any other OAuth client registered at the
   authorization server.

   Protected resources MAY cache the response from the introspection
   endpoint for a period of time no greater than half the lifetime of
   the token.  A protected resource MUST NOT accept a token that is not
   active according to the response from the introspection endpoint.

   Protected resources MUST ensure that the rights associated with the
   token are sufficient to grant access to the resource.  For example,
   this can be accomplished by querying the scopes and acr value
   associated with the token from the authorization server's token
   introspection endpoint.

   Protected resources MUST limit which authorization servers it will
   accept valid tokens from.  A resource server MAY accomplish this
   using a whitelist of trusted servers, a dynamic policy engine, or
   other means.

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  DNSSEC Considerations

   For a comprehensive protection against network attackers, all
   endpoints should additionally use DNSSEC [RFC9364] to protect against
   DNS spoofing attacks that can lead to the issuance of rogue domain-
   validated TLS certificates.

5.2.  Best Practices

   Authorization server, client, and protected resource implementations
   SHOULD consider including requirements from Best Current Practice for
   OAuth 2.0 Security [BCP240], JSON Web Token Best Current Practices
   [RFC8725] and JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access
   Tokens [RFC9068] that are not explicitly mentioned in this profile.

5.3.  Other Considerations

   Authorization Servers SHOULD take into account device posture when
   dealing with native apps if possible.  Some examples of device
   posture include:

   *  the user's lock screen setting

   *  the app's level of privilege over the device operating system
      (e.g. if the app has 'root access', the device operating system
      may be compromised to gain additional privileges not intended by
      the vendor)

   *  the availability of a device attestation to validate the app

   Specific policies or capabilities are outside the scope of this
   specification.

   This profile does not protect against the attacks described in The
   Stronger Attacker Model [pkce-vs-nonce], in which an attacker could
   inject the authorization request and read the authorization response.
   Although using request object signatures would provide mitigation,
   this profile does not require request object signatures because of
   the lack of available implementations.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   This profile addresses the privacy threats identified in Privacy
   Considerations for Internet Protocols [RFC6973] with normative
   language throughout the document.  In particular, this profile
   requires the use of TLS for all network connections, PKCE, and sender
   constrained tokens to mitigate the threats in [RFC6973]

   In OpenID Connect implementations, cilents and servers SHOULD
   implement the privacy threat mitigations in Section 17 of OpenID
   Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core].
