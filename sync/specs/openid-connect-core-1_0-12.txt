                   OpenID Connect Core 1.0 - draft 12

Abstract

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   protocol.  It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
   based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
   well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
   interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This specification defines the core OpenID Connect functionality:
   authentication built on top of OAuth 2.0 and the use of Claims to
   communicate information about the End-User.  It also describes the
   security and privacy considerations for using OpenID Connect.

1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   protocol.  It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
   based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
   well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
   interoperable and REST-like manner.

   The OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification defines the core OpenID
   Connect functionality: authentication built on top of OAuth 2.0 and
   the use of Claims to communicate information about the End-User.  It
   also describes the security and privacy considerations for using
   OpenID Connect.

   As background, the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC6749] and
   OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750] specifications provide a
   general framework for third-party applications to obtain and use
   limited access to HTTP resources.  They define mechanisms to obtain
   and use Access Tokens to access resources but do not define standard
   methods to provide identity information.  Notably, without profiling
   OAuth 2.0, it is incapable of providing information about the
   authentication of an End-User.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are
   to be taken literally.  When using these values in protocol messages,
   the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.

   All uses of JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS] and JSON Web Encryption
   (JWE) [JWE] data structures in this specification utilize the JWS
   Compact Serialization or the JWE Compact Serialization; the JWS JSON
   Serialization and the JWE JSON Serialization are not used.

1.2.  Terminology

   This section defines the terminology used by this specification.
   This section is a normative portion of this specification, imposing
   requirements upon implementations.  All the capitalized words in the
   text of this specification, such as "Issuer Identifier", reference
   these defined terms.  Whenever the reader encounters them, their
   definitions found in this section must be followed.

   This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Refresh Token",

   "Authorization Code", "Authorization Grant", "Authorization Server",
   "Authorization Endpoint", "Client", "Client Identifier", "Client
   Secret", "Protected Resource", "Resource Owner", "Resource Server",
   and "Token Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], and the terms
   "Claim Names" and "Claim Values" defined by JSON Web Token (JWT)
   [JWT].

   This specification also defines the following terms:

   Authentication  Process of verifying that an Entity is the owner of
      an Identity.  Typically this involves the verification of the
      current or past possession of particular credentials, including
      what the entity knows, possesses, has as physical features, or
      behaviors, or combinations of these utilizing heuristics.  The
      entity is often an End-User or a Client.

   Authentication Context  Information that the Relying Party can
      require before it makes an entitlement decision with respect to an
      authentication response.  Such context can include, but is not
      limited to, the actual authentication method used or level of
      assurance such as ISO/IEC 29115 [ISO29115] entity authentication
      assurance level.

   Authentication Context Class  Set of authentication methods or
      procedures that are considered to be equivalent to each other in a
      particular context.

   Authentication Context Class Reference  Identifier for an
      Authentication Context Class.

   Claim  Piece of information asserted about an Entity.

   Claim Type  Syntax used for representing a Claim Value.  This
      specification defines Normal, Aggregated, and Distributed Claim
      Types.

   Claims Provider  Server that can return Claims about an Entity.

   Credential  Data presented as evidence of the right to use an
      identity or other resources.

   End-User  Human Resource Owner.

   Entity  Something that has a separate and distinct existence and that
      can be identified in a context.  An End-User is one example of an
      Entity.

   Essential Claim  Claim specified by the Client as being necessary to
      ensure a smooth authorization experience for the specific task
      requested by the End-User.

   ID Token  JSON Web Token (JWT) [JWT] that contains Claims about the
      authentication event.  It MAY contain other Claims.

   Identifier  Value that uniquely characterizes an Entity in a specific
      context.

   Identity  Set of attributes related to an Entity.

   Issuer  Entity that issues a set of Claims.

   Issuer Identifier  Verifiable Identifier for an Issuer.  An Issuer
      Identifier is a case sensitive URL using the "https" scheme that
      contains scheme, host, and OPTIONALLY, port number and path
      components and no query or fragment components.

   Message  Request or a response between an OpenID Relying Party and an
      OpenID Provider.

   OpenID Provider (OP)  OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server that is capable
      of providing Claims to a Relying Party about the authentication
      event and the End-User in an ID Token and/or a UserInfo Endpoint
      response.

   OP Endpoints  Authorization Endpoint, Token Endpoint, and UserInfo
      Endpoint.

   Request Object  JWT that contains a set of request parameters as its
      Claims.

   Request URI  URL that references a resource containing a Request

1.3.  Overview

   The OpenID Connect protocol, in abstract, follows the following
   steps.

   1.  The RP (Client) sends a request to the OP's (Authorization
       Server's) End-User Authorization Endpoint.

   2.  The OP authenticates the End-User and obtains appropriate
       authorization.

   3.  The OP responds with an Access Token and an ID Token.

   4.  The RP can send a request with the Access Token to the UserInfo
       Endpoint, per Section 2.4.

   5.  The UserInfo Endpoint returns Claims about the End-User.

2.  Messages

   In OpenID Connect, the RP interacts with these endpoints at the OP:

   1.  Authorization Endpoint: The RP sends a request to the OP at the
       Authorization Endpoint.  The OP then authenticates the End-User.
       Then, after potential authorization actions by the End-User, the
       Authorization Server returns an Authorization Response, which can
       include an Authorization Code value.  For some Clients, the
       Implicit Grant will be used to obtain an ID Token and Access
       Token without using an Authorization Code; the "response_type"
       parameter value "id_token token" does this.  For some Clients,
       the Implicit Grant will be used to obtain only an ID Token; the
       "response_type" parameter value "id_token" does this.

   2.  Token Endpoint: Clients using an Authorization Code send an
       Access Token Request containing the Authorization Code to the
       Token Endpoint to obtain an Access Token Response that includes
       an Access Token and an ID Token.  The Client can also send a
       Refresh Token to it to obtain a new Access Token.

   3.  UserInfo Endpoint: Clients using an Access Token send the Access
       Token to the UserInfo Endpoint to obtain Claims about the End-
       User.

2.1.  Authorization Endpoint

   The Authorization Endpoint performs authentication of the End-User
   and requests authorization from the End-User to release information
   to an OpenID Connect Relying Party (Client).  When an End-User
   accesses a Relying Party application that requires the End-User's
   identity and other information, it sends the End-User to the
   Authorization Server's Authorization Endpoint for authentication and
   authorization.  The Authorization Server then issues an ID Token that
   asserts the End-User's identity and, in some cases, also issues an
   Access Token that allows the Client to access the End-User's
   information at Protected Resource endpoints.  Protected Resource
   endpoints MAY perform different actions or return different
   information based on the scopes associated with the presented Access
   Token.

2.1.1.  Protocol Flows

   Authorization Requests follow two main paths to obtain Access Tokens
   and ID Tokens, the Implicit Flow and the Authorization Code Flow.
   The flows determine how the Access Token and ID Token are returned to
   the Client.  Access Tokens are credentials used to access Protected
   Resources, as defined in Section 1.4 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].  Access

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   Tokens represent a Resource Owner's authorization and MUST NOT be
   exposed to unauthorized parties.

   The Implicit Flow is mainly used by Clients implemented in a browser
   using a scripting language.  The Access Token and ID Token are
   returned directly to the Client, which MAY expose them to the
   Resource Owner and other applications that have access to the
   Resource Owner's User-Agent.  The Authorization Server does not
   perform Client Authentication before issuing the Access Token.

   The Authorization Code Flow returns an Authorization Code to the
   Client, which can then exchange it for an Access Token directly.
   This provides the added benefit of not exposing the Access Token to
   the Resource Owner and possibly other malicious applications with
   access to the Resource Owner's User-Agent.  The Authorization Server
   can also authenticate the Client before exchanging the Authorization
   Code for an Access Token.  The Authorization Code flow is suitable
   for Clients that can securely maintain a Client Secret between
   themselves and the Authorization Server whereas the Implicit flow is
   suitable for Clients that cannot.

2.1.1.1.  Obtaining the Authorization Code, ID Token, and Access Token

   In this specification, the Client sends the Authorization Request to
   the Authorization Endpoint through the User-Agent to obtain the ID
   Token and Access Token.  It can obtain them from the Token Endpoint
   utilizing the Authorization Code that it obtained from the
   Authorization Endpoint using the Authorization Code Flow or from the
   Authorization Endpoint using the Implicit Flow.

2.1.1.2.  Authorization Code Flow

   The Authorization Code Flow goes through the following steps.

   1.   Client prepares an Authorization Request containing the desired
        request parameters.

   2.   Client sends a request to the Authorization Server.

   3.   Authorization Server Authenticates the End-User.

   4.   Authorization Server Obtains the End-User Consent/Authorization.

   5.   Authorization Server Sends the End-User back to the Client with
        an Authorization Code.

   6.   Client requests a response using the Authorization Code at the
        Token Endpoint, per Section 2.2.

   7.   Client receives a response that contains an Access Token and ID
        Token in the response body.

   8.   Client validates the ID Token and retrieves the End-User's
        subject identifier.

   9.   (OPTIONAL) Client accesses the UserInfo Endpoint with the Access
        Token, per Section 2.4.

   10.  (OPTIONAL) Client receives UserInfo Response.

   Note that in each step, the party that receives a message MUST
   validate it according to the validation rules in Section 4.4.

2.1.1.3.  Implicit Flow

   The Implicit Flow follows the following steps:

   1.  Client prepares an Authorization Request containing the desired
       request parameters.

   2.  Client sends a request to the Authorization Server.

   3.  Authorization Server Authenticates the End-User.

   4.  Authorization Server Obtains the End-User Consent/Authorization.

   5.  Authorization Server Sends the End-User back to the Client with
       an Access Token and an ID Token if requested.

   6.  Client validates the ID Token and retrieves the End-User's
       subject identifier.

   7.  (OPTIONAL) Client accesses the UserInfo Endpoint with the Access
       Token, per Section 2.4.

   8.  (OPTIONAL) Client receives UserInfo Response.

   Note that in each step, the party that receives a message MUST
   validate it according to the validation rules in Section 4.4.

2.1.2.  Authorization Request

   When the Client wishes to access a Protected Resource and the End-
   User Authorization has not yet been obtained, the Client prepares an
   Authorization Request to the Authorization Endpoint.

   An Authorization Request is a message sent from an RP to the OP's

   Authorization Endpoint.  It is an extended OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749]
   Authorization Request.  Section 4.1.1 and 4.2.1 of OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749] define the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request parameters.

   Communication with the Authorization Endpoint MUST utilize TLS.  See
   Section 11.16 for more information on using TLS.

   Authorization Servers MUST support the use of the HTTP "GET" and
   "POST" methods defined in RFC 2616 [RFC2616] at the Authorization
   Endpoint.

   Clients MAY use the HTTP "GET" or "POST" methods to send the
   Authorization Request to the Authorization Server.  If using the HTTP
   "GET" method, the request parameters are serialized using URI Query
   String Serialization, per Section 8.1.  If using the HTTP "POST"
   method, the request parameters are serialized using Form
   Serialization, per Section 8.2.

2.1.2.1.  Request Parameters

   OpenID Connect uses the following OAuth 2.0 request parameters:

   response_type  REQUIRED.  OAuth 2.0 registered response type value
      that determines how the Authorization Response is returned to the
      Client.  As described in OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding
      Practices [OAuth.Responses], the following registered values are
      supported by OpenID Connect:

      *  "code"

      *  "code id_token"

      *  "id_token"

      *  "id_token token"

      *  "code token"

      *  "code id_token token"

      The OAuth 2.0 specification defines two response types:

      code  When supplied as the value for the "response_type"
         parameter, a successful response MUST include an Authorization
         Code as defined in OAuth 2.0.  Both successful and error
         responses MUST be added as parameters to the query component of
         the response.  All tokens are returned from the Token Endpoint.
         When used by OpenID Connect, an ID Token is also returned from

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


         the Token Endpoint.  OpenID Providers that are not Self-Issued
         OPs MUST support this "response_type".

      token  When supplied as the value for the "response_type"
         parameter, a successful response MUST include an Access Token
         as defined in OAuth 2.0.  Both successful and error responses
         MUST be fragment-encoded.  No ID Token is provided to the
         Client; therefore, this "response_type" is not used by OpenID
         Connect.

      OpenID Connect supports these additional response types
      [OAuth.Responses], which have been registered with IANA:



      id_token  When supplied as the value for the "response_type"
         parameter, a successful response MUST include an ID Token.
         Both successful and error responses SHOULD be fragment-encoded.
         OpenID Providers MUST support this "response_type".

      id_token token  When supplied as the value for the "response_type"
         parameter, a successful response MUST include both an Access
         Token and an ID Token.  Both successful and error responses
         SHOULD be fragment-encoded.  OpenID Providers MUST support this
         "response_type".

      code token  When supplied as the value for the "response_type"
         parameter, a successful response MUST include both an Access
         Token and an Authorization Code as defined in OAuth 2.0.  When
         used by OpenID Connect, an ID Token is also returned from the
         Token Endpoint.  Both successful and error responses SHOULD be
         fragment-encoded.

      code id_token  When supplied as the value for the "response_type"
         parameter, a successful response MUST include both an
         Authorization Code and an ID Token.  Both successful and error
         responses SHOULD be fragment-encoded.

      code id_token token  When supplied as the value for the
         "response_type" parameter, a successful response MUST include
         an Authorization Code, an ID Token, and an Access Token.  Both
         successful and error responses SHOULD be fragment-encoded.

      All OpenID Providers MUST support the "id_token" response type and
      all OpenID Providers that are not Self-Issued OPs MUST also
      support the "id_token token" and "code" response types.





Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 13]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


      The Client can use any OAuth 2.0 registered response type
      supported by the OpenID Provider other than "token" (which
      provides no ID Token).

   client_id  REQUIRED.  OAuth 2.0 Client Identifier.

   scope  REQUIRED.  Space delimited, case sensitive list of ASCII OAuth
      2.0 scope values.  OpenID Connect requests MUST contain the
      "openid" scope value.  OPTIONAL scope values of "profile",
      "email", "address", "phone", and "offline_access" are also
      defined.  See Section 2.5 for more about the scope values defined
      by this specification.

   redirect_uri  REQUIRED.  Redirection URI to which the response will
      be sent.  This MUST be pre-registered with the OpenID Provider.
      This URI MUST exactly match one of the "redirect_uris" registered
      for the Client, with the matching performed as described in
      Section 6.2.1 of [RFC3986] (Simple String Comparison).  If the
      Client uses the OAuth implicit grant type, the redirection URI
      MUST NOT use the "http" scheme unless the Client is a native
      application, in which case it MAY use the "http:" scheme with
      "localhost" as the hostname.  If the Client only uses the OAuth
      "authorization_code" grant type, the redirection URI MAY use the
      "http" scheme, provided that the Client Type is "confidential", as
      defined in Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0.

   state  RECOMMENDED.  Opaque value used to maintain state between the
      request and the callback.  Typically, Cross-Site Request Forgery
      (CSRF, XSRF) mitigation is done by cryptographically binding the
      value of this parameter with the browser cookie.

   This specification also defines the following request parameters:

   nonce  REQUIRED or OPTIONAL.  String value used to associate a Client
      session with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks.  The
      value is passed through unmodified from the Authorization Request
      to the ID Token.  Sufficient entropy MUST be present in the
      "nonce" values used to prevent attackers from guessing values.
      One method to achieve this is to store a random value as a signed
      session cookie, and pass the value in the "nonce" parameter.  In
      that case, the "nonce" in the returned ID Token can be compared to
      the signed session cookie to detect ID Token replay by third
      parties.  Use of the nonce is REQUIRED for all requests where an
      ID Token is returned directly from the Authorization Endpoint.  It
      is OPTIONAL when the ID Token is returned from the Token Endpoint.

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   display  OPTIONAL.  ASCII string value that specifies how the
      Authorization Server displays the authentication and consent user
      interface pages to the End-User.  The defined values are:

      page  The Authorization Server SHOULD display authentication and
         consent UI consistent with a full User-Agent page view.  If the
         display parameter is not specified this is the default display
         mode.

      popup  The Authorization Server SHOULD display authentication and
         consent UI consistent with a popup User-Agent window.  The
         popup User-Agent window SHOULD be 450 pixels wide and 500
         pixels tall.

      touch  The Authorization Server SHOULD display authentication and
         consent UI consistent with a device that leverages a touch
         interface.  The Authorization Server MAY attempt to detect the
         touch device and further customize the interface.

      wap  The Authorization Server SHOULD display authentication and
         consent UI consistent with a "feature phone" type display.

   prompt  OPTIONAL.  Space delimited, case sensitive list of ASCII
      string values that specifies whether the Authorization Server
      prompts the End-User for reauthentication and consent.  The
      defined values are:

      none  The Authorization Server MUST NOT display any authentication
         or consent user interface pages.  An error is returned if the
         End-User is not already authenticated or the Client does not
         have pre-configured consent for the requested Claims or does
         not fulfill other conditions for processing.  This can be used
         as a method to check for existing authentication and/or
         consent.

      login  The Authorization Server SHOULD prompt the End-User for
         reauthentication.  If it cannot prompt the End-User, it MUST
         return an error.

      consent  The Authorization Server SHOULD prompt the End-User for
         consent before returning information to the Client.

      select_account  The Authorization Server SHOULD prompt the End-
         User to select a user account.  This allows an End-User who has
         multiple accounts at the Authorization Server to select amongst
         the multiple accounts that they might have current sessions
         for.  If it cannot prompt the End-User, it MUST return an
         error.

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


      The "prompt" parameter can be used by the Client to make sure that
      the End-User is still present for the current session or to bring
      attention to the request.  If this parameter contains "none" with
      any other value, an error is returned.

   max_age  OPTIONAL.  Maximum Authentication Age. Specifies the
      allowable elapsed time in seconds since the last time the End-User
      was actively authenticated.  If the elapsed time is greater than
      this value, the OP MUST attempt to actively re-authenticate the
      End-User.  (The "max_age" request parameter corresponds to the
      OpenID 2.0 PAPE [OpenID.PAPE] "max_auth_age" request parameter.)
      When "max_age" is used, the ID Token returned MUST include an
      "auth_time" Claim Value.

   ui_locales  OPTIONAL.  End-User's preferred languages and scripts for
      the user interface, represented as a space-separated list of BCP47
      [RFC5646] language tag values, ordered by preference.  For
      instance, the value "fr-CA fr en" represents a preference for
      French as spoken in Canada, then French (without a region
      designation), followed by English (without a region designation).
      An error SHOULD NOT result if some or all of the requested locales
      are not supported by the OpenID Provider.

   claims_locales  OPTIONAL.  End-User's preferred languages and scripts
      for Claims being returned, represented as a space-separated list
      of BCP47 [RFC5646] language tag values, ordered by preference.  An
      error SHOULD NOT result if some or all of the requested locales
      are not supported by the OpenID Provider.

   id_token_hint  OPTIONAL.  Previously issued ID Token passed to the
      Authorization Server as a hint about the End-User's current or
      past authenticated session with the Client.  This SHOULD be
      present when "prompt=none" is used.  If the End-User identified by
      the ID Token is logged in or is logged in by the request, then the
      Authorization Server returns a positive response; otherwise, it
      SHOULD return a negative response.  The Authorization Server need
      not be listed as an audience of the ID Token when it is used as an
      "id_token_hint" value.

      If the ID Token received by the RP is encrypted, the Client MUST
      decrypt the signed ID Token contained within the encrypted ID
      Token.  The Client MAY re-encrypt the signed ID token to the
      Authentication Server using a key that enables the server to
      decrypt the ID Token.

      For a Self-Issued ID Token, the "sub" (subject) of the signed ID
      Token MUST be sent as the "kid" (Key ID) of the JWE.

   login_hint  OPTIONAL.  Hint to the Authorization Server about the
      login identifier the End-User might use to log in (if necessary).
      This hint can be used by an RP if it first asks the End-User for
      their e-mail address (or other identifier) and then wants to pass
      that value as a hint to the discovered authorization service.  It
      is RECOMMENDED that the hint value match the value used for
      discovery.  This value MAY also be a phone number in the format
      specified for the "phone_number" Claim.  The use of this parameter
      is left to the OP's discretion.

   acr_values  OPTIONAL.  Requested Authentication Context Class
      Reference values.  Space-separated string that specifies the "acr"
      values that the Authorization Server is being requested to use for
      processing this authentication request, with the values appearing
      in order of preference.  The Authentication Context Class
      satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the "acr"
      Claim Value, as specified in Section 2.1.5.1.  The "acr" Claim is
      requested as a Voluntary Claim by this parameter.

   claims  OPTIONAL.  This parameter is used to request that specific
      Claims be returned.  The value is a JSON object listing the
      requested Claims, as specified in Section 2.7.

   registration  OPTIONAL.  This parameter is used by the Client to
      provide information about itself to a Self-Issued OP that would
      normally be provided to an OP during Dynamic Client Registration,
      as specified in Section 7.2.1.  The "registration" parameter
      SHOULD NOT be used when the OP is not a Self-Issued OP.

   request  OPTIONAL.  This parameter enables OpenID Connect requests to
      be passed in a single, self-contained parameter and to be signed
      and optionally encrypted.  The parameter value is a Request Object
      value, as specified in Section 2.10.1.  It represents the request
      as a JWT whose Claims are the request parameters above.

      When the "request" parameter is used, the OpenID Connect request
      parameter values contained in the JWT supersede those passed using
      the OAuth 2.0 request syntax.  Even if a "scope" parameter is
      present in the Request Object value, a "scope" parameter MUST
      always be passed using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax containing the
      "openid" scope value to indicate to the underlying OAuth 2.0 logic
      that this is an OpenID Connect request.

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   request_uri  OPTIONAL.  This parameter enables OpenID Connect
      requests to be passed by reference, rather than by value.  The
      "request_uri" value is a URL using the "https" scheme referencing
      a resource containing a Request Object value, which is a JWT
      containing the request parameters.  This parameter is used
      identically to the "request" parameter, other than that the
      Request Object value is retrieved from the specified URL, rather
      than passed by value.  See Section 2.10.2 for more information on
      using the "request_uri" parameter.

2.1.3.  Authorization Server Authenticates End-User

   The Authorization Server validates the request to ensure all REQUIRED
   parameters are present and all parameters are valid.  If the request
   is valid, the Authorization Server attempts to log in the End-User or
   determines whether he is logged in, depending upon the request
   parameter values used.  The methods used by the Authorization Server
   to log in the End-User (e.g. username and password, session cookies,
   etc.) are beyond the scope of this specification.  An authentication
   user interface MAY be displayed by the Authorization Server,
   depending upon the request parameter values used and the
   authentication methods used.

   The Authorization Server MUST attempt to log in the End-User in the
   following cases:

   o  The End-User is not already logged in.

   o  The Authorization Request contains the "prompt" parameter with the
      value "login".  In this case, the Authorization Server MUST
      reauthenticate the End-User even if the End-User is already
      authenticated.

   The Authorization Server MUST NOT interact with the End-User in the
   following case:

   o  The Authorization Request contains the "prompt" parameter with the
      value "none".  In this case, the Authorization Server MUST return
      an error if the End-User is not already logged in or could not be
      silently logged in.

   The Authorization Server MUST employ appropriate measures against
   Cross-Site Request Forgery and Clickjacking as, described in Sections
   10.12 and 10.13 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].

2.1.4.  Authorization Server Obtains End-User Consent/Authorization

   Once the End-User is authenticated, the Authorization Server MUST
   obtain an authorization decision.  This MAY be done by presenting the
   End-User with a dialogue that allows the End-User to recognize what
   he is consenting to and obtain his consent or by establishing consent
   via conditions for processing or other means (for example, via
   previous administrative consent).

   The Authorization Server MUST attempt to request authorization from
   the End-User in the following cases:

   o  The End-User has not pre-authorized the Client for the
      Authorization Request.

   o  The Authorization Request contains the "prompt" parameter with the
      value "consent".  The Authorization Server SHOULD request End-User
      authorization even if the End-User has previously authorized the
      Client.

   The Authorization Server MUST NOT request End-User authorization in
   the following cases:

   o  The Authorization Request contains the "prompt" parameter with the
      value "none".  The Authorization Server MUST return an error if
      the End-User has not pre-authorized the Client.

   The Authorization Server MUST employ countermeasures against Cross-
   Site Request Forgery and Clickjacking when interacting with the End-
   User.

2.1.5.  Successful Authorization Response

   Once the authorization is determined, the Authorization Server
   returns a successful or error response.  This section describes the
   successful response.  Section 2.1.6 describes the error response.

   An Authorization Response is a message returned from the OP's
   Authorization Endpoint in response to the Authorization Request by
   the RP.  Response parameters are returned to the Client by adding
   them to the "redirect_uri" specified in the Authorization Request
   using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format.

   Note that if the "response_type" parameter in the Authorization
   Request includes the string value "token" or "id_token", all response
   parameters are added to the fragment component of the redirection
   URI, as specified in OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding
   Practices [OAuth.Responses].  Otherwise, the response parameters are



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 19]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   added to the query component of the redirection URI.

   This specification only describes OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage
   [RFC6750].  The OAuth 2.0 response parameter "token_type" MUST be set
   to "Bearer" unless another Token Type has been negotiated with the
   Client.

   When the "response_type" in the request is "code", the Authorization
   Response MUST return the parameters defined in Section 4.1.2 of OAuth
   2.0 [RFC6749].

   When the "response_type" includes other values, they MUST be returned
   as defined by their registration.  The "id_token", "code id_token",
   "id_token token", "code token", and "code id_token token" response
   types are defined in OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding
   Practices [OAuth.Responses].

2.1.5.1.  ID Token

   The ID Token is a security token that contains Claims about the
   authentication event and other requested Claims.  The ID Token is
   represented as a JSON Web Token (JWT) [JWT].

   The ID Token is used to manage the authentication event and user
   identifier and is scoped to a particular Client via the "aud"
   (audience) and "nonce" Claims.

   The following Claims are used within the ID Token:

   iss  REQUIRED.  Issuer Identifier for the Issuer of the response.
      The "iss" value is a case sensitive URL using the "https" scheme
      that contains scheme, host, and OPTIONALLY, port number and path
      components and no query or fragment components.

   sub  REQUIRED.  Subject identifier.  A locally unique and never
      reassigned identifier within the Issuer for the End-User, which is
      intended to be consumed by the Client, e.g., "24400320" or
      "AItOawmwtWwcT0k51BayewNvutrJUqsvl6qs7A4".  It MUST NOT exceed 255
      ASCII characters in length.  The "sub" value is a case sensitive
      string.

   aud  REQUIRED.  Audience(s) that this ID Token is intended for.  It
      MUST contain the OAuth 2.0 "client_id" of the Relying Party as an
      audience value.  It MAY also contain identifiers for other
      audiences.  In the general case, the "aud" value is an array of
      case sensitive strings.  In the special case when there is one
      audience, the "aud" value MAY be a single case sensitive string.




Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 20]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   exp  REQUIRED.  Expiration time on or after which the ID Token MUST
      NOT be accepted for processing.  The processing of this parameter
      requires that the current date/time MUST be before the expiration
      date/time listed in the value.  Implementers MAY provide for some
      small leeway, usually no more than a few minutes, to account for
      clock skew.  The time is represented as the number of seconds from
      1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.  See RFC
      3339 [RFC3339] for details regarding date/times in general and UTC
      in particular.  The "exp" value is a number.

   iat  REQUIRED.  Time at which the JWT was issued.  The time is
      represented as the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as
      measured in UTC until the date/time.  The "iat" value is a number.

   auth_time  OPTIONAL or REQUIRED.  Time when the End-User
      authentication occurred.  The time is represented as the number of
      seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/
      time.  When a "max_age" request is made or when "auth_time" is
      requested as an Essential Claim, then this Claim is REQUIRED.
      (The "auth_time" Claim semantically corresponds to the OpenID 2.0
      PAPE [OpenID.PAPE] "auth_time" response parameter.)  The
      "auth_time" value is a number.

   nonce  OPTIONAL or REQUIRED.  String value used to associate a Client
      session with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks.  The
      value is passed through unmodified from the Authorization Request
      to the ID Token.  If present in the ID Token, Clients MUST verify
      that the "nonce" Claim Value is equal to the value of the "nonce"
      parameter sent in the Authorization Request.  If present in the
      Authorization Request, Authorization Servers MUST include a
      "nonce" Claim in the ID Token with the Claim Value being the nonce
      value sent in the Authorization Request.  Authorization Servers
      SHOULD perform no other processing on "nonce" values used.  Use of
      the nonce is REQUIRED for all requests where an ID Token is
      returned directly from the Authorization Endpoint.  It is OPTIONAL
      when the ID Token is returned from the Token Endpoint.  The
      "nonce" value is a case sensitive string.

   at_hash  OPTIONAL or REQUIRED.  Access Token hash value.  If the ID
      Token is issued from the Authorization Endpoint with an
      "access_token", this is REQUIRED.  This is OPTIONAL when the ID
      Token is issued from the Token Endpoint.  Its value is the
      base64url encoding of the left-most half of the hash of the octets
      of the ASCII representation of the "access_token" value, where the
      hash algorithm used is the hash algorithm used in the "alg"
      parameter of the ID Token's JWS [JWS] header.  For instance, if
      the "alg" is "RS256", hash the "access_token" value with SHA-256,
      then take the left-most 128 bits and base64url encode them.  The



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 21]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


      "at_hash" value is a case sensitive string.

   c_hash  Sometimes REQUIRED.  Code hash value.  If the ID Token is
      issued from the Authorization Endpoint with a "code", this is
      REQUIRED.  Its value is the base64url encoding of the left-most
      half of the hash of the octets of the ASCII representation of the
      "code" value, where the hash algorithm used is the hash algorithm
      used in the "alg" parameter of the ID Token's JWS [JWS] header.
      For instance, if the "alg" is "HS512", hash the "code" value with
      SHA-512, then take the left-most 256 bits and base64url encode
      them.  The "c_hash" value is a case sensitive string.

   acr  OPTIONAL.  Authentication Context Class Reference.  String
      specifying an Authentication Context Class Reference value that
      identifies the Authentication Context Class that the
      authentication performed satisfied.  The value "0" indicates the
      End-User authentication did not meet the requirements of ISO/IEC
      29115 [ISO29115] level 1.  Authentication using a long-lived
      browser cookie, for instance, is one example where the use of
      "level 0" is appropriate.  Authentications with level 0 SHOULD
      never be used to authorize access to any resource of any monetary
      value.  (This corresponds to the OpenID 2.0 PAPE [OpenID.PAPE]
      "nist_auth_level" 0.)  An absolute URI or a registered name
      [RFC6711] SHOULD be used as the "acr" value; registered names MUST
      NOT be used with a different meaning than that which is
      registered.  Parties using this claim will need to agree upon the
      meanings of the values used, which may be context-specific.  The
      "acr" value is a case sensitive string.

   amr  OPTIONAL.  Authentication Methods References.  JSON array of
      strings that are identifiers for authentication methods used in
      the authentication.  For instance, values might indicate that both
      password and OTP authentication methods were used.  The definition
      of particular values to be used in the "amr" Claim is beyond the
      scope of this specification.  Parties using this claim will need
      to agree upon the meanings of the values used, which may be
      context-specific.  The "amr" value is an array of case sensitive
      strings.

   azp  OPTIONAL or REQUIRED.  Authorized Party - the party to which the
      ID Token was issued.  If present, it MUST contain the OAuth 2.0
      "client_id" of the party that will be using it.  This Claim is
      only REQUIRED when the party requesting the ID Token is not the
      same as the sole audience of the ID Token.  It MAY be included
      even when the Authorized Party is the same as the sole audience.
      The "azp" value is a case sensitive string containing a
      StringOrURI value.

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   sub_jwk  NOT RECOMMENDED or REQUIRED.  Public key value used to check
      the signature of an ID Token issued by a Self-Issued OpenID
      Provider, as specified in Section 7.  The key is a bare key in JWK
      [JWK] format (not an X.509 certificate value).  Use of the
      "sub_jwk" Claim is REQUIRED when the OP is a Self-Issued OP and is
      NOT RECOMMENDED when the OP is not Self-Issued.  The "iss" value
      is a JSON object.

   ID Tokens MAY contain other Claims.  Any Claims used that are not
   understood MUST be ignored.

   ID Tokens MUST be signed using JWS [JWS] and OPTIONALLY both signed
   and then encrypted using JWS [JWS] and JWE [JWE] respectively,
   thereby providing authentication, integrity, non-repudiation, and
   optionally, confidentiality, per Section 11.13.  ID Tokens MUST NOT
   use "none" as the "alg" value.

   ID Tokens SHOULD NOT use the JWS or JWE "x5u", "x5c", "jku", or "jwk"
   header parameter fields.  Instead, key values and key references used
   for ID Tokens are communicated in advance using Discovery and
   Registration parameters.

   Clients MUST validate the ID Token per Section 4.3.

   The following is a non-normative example of a base64url decoded ID
   Token:

     {
      "iss": "https://server.example.com",
      "sub": "24400320",
      "aud": "s6BhdRkqt3",
      "nonce": "n-0S6_WzA2Mj",
      "exp": 1311281970,
      "iat": 1311280970,
      "auth_time": 1311280969,
      "acr": "urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver",
      "at_hash": "MTIzNDU2Nzg5MDEyMzQ1Ng"
     }

2.1.6.  Authorization Error Response

   If the End-User denies the access request or if the request fails,
   the OP (Authorization Server) informs the RP (Client) by using the
   Error Response parameters defined in Sections 4.1.2.1 or 4.2.2.1 of
   OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], according to the "response_type" used.

   The Authorization Server returns the Client to the redirection URI
   specified in the Authorization Request with the appropriate error



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 23]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   parameters.  No other parameters SHOULD be returned.

   In addition to the error codes defined in Sections 4.1.2.1 and
   4.2.2.1 of OAuth 2.0, this specification also defines the following
   error codes:

   interaction_required  The Authorization Server requires End-User
      interaction of some form to proceed.  This error MAY be returned
      when the "prompt" parameter in the Authorization Request is set to
      "none" to request that the Authorization Server SHOULD NOT display
      any user interfaces to the End-User, but the Authorization Request
      cannot be completed without displaying a user interface for End-
      User interaction.

   login_required  The Authorization Server requires End-User
      authentication.  This error MAY be returned when the "prompt"
      parameter in the Authorization Request is set to "none" to request
      that the Authorization Server SHOULD NOT display any user
      interfaces to the End-User, but the Authorization Request cannot
      be completed without displaying a user interface for user
      authentication.

   session_selection_required  The End-User is REQUIRED to select a
      session at the Authorization Server.  The End-User MAY be
      authenticated at the Authorization Server with different
      associated accounts, but the End-User did not select a session.
      This error MAY be returned when the "prompt" parameter in the
      Authorization Request is set to "none" to request that the
      Authorization Server SHOULD NOT display any user interfaces to the
      End-User, but the Authorization Request cannot be completed
      without displaying a user interface to prompt for a session to
      use.

   consent_required  The Authorization Server requires End-User consent.
      This error MAY be returned when the "prompt" parameter in the
      Authorization Request is set to "none" to request that the
      Authorization Server SHOULD NOT display any user interfaces to the
      End-User, but the Authorization Request cannot be completed
      without displaying a user interface for End-User consent.

   invalid_request_uri  The "request_uri" in the Authorization Request
      returns an error or contains invalid data.

   invalid_request_object  The "request" parameter contains an invalid
      Request Object.

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   registration_not_supported  The OP does not support use of the
      "registration" parameter.

   request_not_supported  The OP does not support use of the "request"
      parameter.

   request_uri_not_supported  The OP does not support use of the
      "request_uri" parameter.

   The error response parameters are the following:

   error  REQUIRED.  Error code.

   error_description  OPTIONAL.  Human-readable ASCII encoded text
      description of the error.

   error_uri  OPTIONAL.  URI of a web page that includes additional
      information about the error.

   state  OAuth 2.0 state value.  REQUIRED if the Authorization Request
      included the "state" parameter.  Set to the value received from
      the Client.

   If the "response_type" parameter in the Authorization Request
   includes the string value "token" or "id_token", all error response
   parameters are be added to the fragment component of the redirection
   URI, as specified in OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding
   Practices [OAuth.Responses].  Otherwise, the response parameters are
   added to the query component of the redirection URI.

   The following is a non-normative example response (with line wraps
   within values for the display purposes only):

     HTTP/1.1 302 Found
     Location: https://client.example.org/cb?
       error=invalid_request
       &error_description=
         the%20request%20is%20not%20valid%20or%20malformed
       &state=af0ifjsldkj

2.2.  Token Endpoint

   When using the Authorization Code Flow, the RP (Client) sends an
   Access Token Request to the Token Endpoint to obtain an Access Token
   Response, which MAY include an Access Token, a Refresh Token, an ID
   Token, and other results.

   Clients MUST use the HTTP "POST" method to make requests to the Token



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 25]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   Endpoint.  Request parameters are added using Form Serialization, per
   Section 8.2.  The Token Endpoint MUST support the use of the HTTP
   "POST" method defined in RFC 2616 [RFC2616] at the Token Endpoint.

   Communication with the Token Endpoint MUST utilize TLS.  See
   Section 11.16 for more information on using TLS.

   All Token Endpoint responses that contain tokens, secrets, or other
   sensitive information MUST include the following HTTP response header
   fields and values:

                     +---------------+--------------+
                     | Header Name   | Header Value |
                     +---------------+--------------+
                     | Cache-Control | no-store     |
                     |               |              |
                     | Pragma        | no-cache     |
                     +---------------+--------------+

                     HTTP Response Headers and Values

2.2.1.  Client Authentication

   Clients MAY provide authentication parameters in the request to the
   Token Endpoint, as described in this section.

   During Client Registration, the RP (Client) MAY register an
   authentication method.  If no method is registered, the default
   method of "client_secret_basic" MUST be used.

   The Supported options are:

   client_secret_basic  Clients that have received a "client_secret"
      value from the Authorization Server, authenticate with the
      Authorization Server in accordance with Section 3.2.1 of OAuth 2.0
      [RFC6749] using HTTP Basic authentication scheme.

   client_secret_post  Clients that have received a "client_secret"
      value from the Authorization Server, authenticate with the
      Authorization Server in accordance with Section 3.2.1 of OAuth 2.0
      [RFC6749] by including the Client Credentials in the request body.

   client_secret_jwt  Clients that have received a "client_secret" value
      from the Authorization Server create a JWT using an HMAC SHA
      algorithm, such as HMAC SHA-256.  The HMAC (Hash-based Message
      Authentication Code) is calculated using the octets of the UTF-8
      representation of the "client_secret" as the shared key.




Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 26]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


      The Client authenticates in accordance with Section 2.2 of OAuth
      JWT Bearer Token Profiles [OAuth.JWT] and OAuth 2.0 Assertion
      Profile [OAuth.Assertions].  The JWT MUST contain the following
      REQUIRED Claim Values and MAY contain the following OPTIONAL Claim
      Values:



      iss  REQUIRED.  Issuer.  This MUST contain the "client_id" of the
         OAuth Client.

      sub  REQUIRED.  Subject.  This MUST contain the "client_id" of the
         OAuth Client.

      aud  REQUIRED.  Audience.  The "aud" (audience) Claim.  Value that
         identifies the Authorization Server as an intended audience.
         The Authorization Server MUST verify that it is an intended
         audience for the token.  The Audience SHOULD be the URL of the
         Authorization Server's Token Endpoint.

      jti  REQUIRED.  JWT ID.  A unique identifier for the token.  The
         JWT ID MAY be used by implementations requiring message de-
         duplication for one-time use assertions.

      exp  REQUIRED.  Expiration time on or after which the ID Token
         MUST NOT be accepted for processing.

      iat  OPTIONAL.  Time at which the JWT was issued.

      ID Tokens MAY contain other Claims.  Any Claims used that are not
      understood MUST be ignored.

      The authentication token MUST be sent as the value of the
      [OAuth.Assertions] "client_assertion" parameter.

      The value of the [OAuth.Assertions] "client_assertion_type"
      parameter MUST be
      "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer", per
      [OAuth.JWT].

   private_key_jwt  Clients that have registered a public key sign a JWT
      using that key.  The Client authenticates in accordance with
      Section 2.2 of OAuth JWT Bearer Token Profiles [OAuth.JWT] and
      OAuth 2.0 Assertion Profile [OAuth.Assertions].  The JWT MUST
      contain the following REQUIRED Claim Values and MAY contain the

      iss  REQUIRED.  Issuer.  This MUST contain the "client_id" of the
         OAuth Client.

      sub  REQUIRED.  Subject.  This MUST contain the "client_id" of the
         OAuth Client.

      aud  REQUIRED.  Audience.  The "aud" (audience) Claim.  Value that
         identifies the Authorization Server as an intended audience.
         The Authorization Server MUST verify that it is an intended
         audience for the token.  The Audience SHOULD be the URL of the
         Authorization Server's Token Endpoint.

      jti  REQUIRED.  JWT ID.  A unique identifier for the token.  The
         JWT ID MAY be used by implementations requiring message de-
         duplication for one-time use assertions.

      exp  REQUIRED.  Expiration time on or after which the ID Token
         MUST NOT be accepted for processing.

      iat  OPTIONAL.  Time at which the JWT was issued.

      The JWT MAY contain other Claims.  Any Claims used that are not
      understood MUST be ignored.

      The authentication token MUST be sent as the value of the
      [OAuth.Assertions] "client_assertion" parameter.

      The value of the [OAuth.Assertions] "client_assertion_type"
      parameter MUST be
      "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer", per
      [OAuth.JWT].

2.2.2.  Access Token Request

   A Client using the Authorization Code Flow obtains an Access Token by
   authenticating with the Authorization Server and presenting its
   Authorization Grant (in the form of an Authorization Code or Refresh
   Token) to the Token Endpoint.

   In addition to the Client authentication parameters, if this is a
   Refresh Token Request, the Client MUST send the additional parameters
   specified in Section 6 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].  Otherwise, the Client
   MUST send the request parameters as specified in Section 4.1.3 of
   OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].

   To obtain an Access Token, Refresh Token or ID Token, the Client MUST
   authenticate to the Token Endpoint using the authentication method
   registered for its "client_id", as described in Section 2.2.1.  The
   Client sends the parameters via HTTPS "POST" to the Token Endpoint
   using Form Serialization, per Section 8.2, as described in Section
   4.1.3 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].

   The following is a non-normative example of an Access Token Request:

     POST /token HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
     Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW

     grant_type=authorization_code&code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
       &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb

   The Authorization Server MUST:

   o  Authenticate any Clients that were issued Client Credentials (or
      for which other Client Authentication methods can be used),

   o  Ensure the Authorization Code was issued to the authenticated
      Client,

   o  Verify that the Authorization Code is valid, and

   o  Ensure that the Scheme, Host, Path, and Query Parameter segments
      in the "redirect_uri" parameter are identical to the
      "redirect_uri" parameter value that was included in the initial
      Authorization Request.  If the "redirect_uri" parameter value not
      be present when there is only one registered "redirect_uri" value,
      the Authorization Server MAY return an error (since the Client



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 29]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


      should have included the parameter) or MAY proceed without an
      error (since OAuth 2.0 permits the parameter to be omitted in this
      case).

2.2.3.  Access Token Response

   Upon receipt of the Token Request, the Authorization Server MUST
   return either a successful response or an error response that
   corresponds to the received Authorization Code.

   After receiving and validating a valid and authorized Access Token
   Request from the Client, the Authorization Server returns a
   successful response that includes an Access Token and an ID Token.
   The parameters in the successful response are defined in Section
   4.1.4 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].

   This specification only describes OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage
   [RFC6750].  The OAuth 2.0 response parameter "token_type" MUST be set
   to "Bearer" unless another Token Type has been negotiated with the
   Client.  Servers SHOULD support OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage
   [RFC6750] for interoperability.  For security reasons Servers MAY
   only allow Clients to register specific "token_type".  Clients MUST
   support OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750] and MAY support other
   "token_type".

   In addition to the OAuth 2.0 response parameters, the following
   parameters MUST be included in the response if the "grant_type" value
   is "authorization_code" and the Authorization Request "scope"
   parameter contained "openid":

   id_token  ID Token value associated with the authenticated session.

   An "id_token" MUST be returned when the "grant_type" value is
   "authorization_code" and MAY be returned when other grant types are
   used.

   A successful response returns the "application/json" media type.

   The following is a non-normative example of a token request:

     {
      "access_token": "SlAV32hkKG",
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "refresh_token": "8xLOxBtZp8",
      "expires_in": 3600,
      "id_token": "eyJ0 ... NiJ9.eyJ1c ... I6IjIifX0.DeWt4Qu ... ZXso"
     }

   The following is a non-normative example of a successful token
   response:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: application/json
     Cache-Control: no-store
     Pragma: no-cache

     {

        tqkqHxKsAXLVyAoVInYkl_NDBkCqYe2KgNJFzfEC8g"
     }

   As in the OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], Clients SHOULD ignore unrecognized
   response parameters.

   If an ID Token is returned as a result of a token refresh request,
   the following requirements apply:

   o  its "iss" Claim value MUST be the same as in the ID Token issued
      when the original authentication occurred,

   o  its "sub" Claim value MUST be the same as in the ID Token issued
      when the original authentication occurred,

   o  its "iat" Claim MUST represent the time that the new ID Token is
      issued,

   o  its "aud" Claim value MUST be the same as in the ID Token issued
      when the original authentication occurred,

   o  if the ID Token contains an "auth_time" Claim, its value MUST
      represent the time of the original authentication - not the time
      that the new ID token is issued,





Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 31]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   o  its "azp" Claim value MUST be the same as in the ID Token issued
      when the original authentication occurred; if no "azp" Claim was
      present in the original ID Token, one MUST NOT be present in the
      new ID Token, and

   o  otherwise, the same rules apply as apply when issuing an ID Token
      at the time of the original authentication.

2.2.4.  Access Token Error Response

   If the Token Request is invalid or unauthorized, the Authorization
   Server constructs the error response.  The parameters of the Token
   Error Response are defined as in Section 5.2 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].
   The HTTP response body uses the "application/json" media type with
   HTTP response code of 400.

   The following is a non-normative example token error response:

     HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
     Content-Type: application/json
     Cache-Control: no-store
     Pragma: no-cache

     {
      "error": "invalid_request"
     }

2.3.  Refreshing Access Token

   To refresh an Access Token, the Client MUST authenticate to the Token
   Endpoint using the authentication method registered for its
   "client_id", as documented in Section 2.2.1.  The Client sends the
   parameters via HTTPS "POST" to the Token Endpoint using Form
   Serialization, per Section 8.2, as described in Section 6 of OAuth
   2.0 [RFC6749]:

   The Authorization Server MUST validate the Refresh Token.

2.3.1.  Refresh Token Response

   Upon receipt of the Refresh Token Request, the Authorization Server
   MUST return either a successful response or an error response that
   corresponds to the received Refresh Token.

   Upon successful validation of the Refresh Token, a successful
   response returns the "application/json" media type and the response
   body is the Access Token Response of Section 2.2.3 except that it
   MUST NOT return an "id_token".

   The following is a non-normative example of a Refresh Token Request
   and Response:

     POST /token HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

     client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
       &client_secret=some_secret12345
       &grant_type=refresh_token
       &refresh_token=8xLOxBtZp8
       &scope=openid%20profile

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: application/json
     Cache-Control: no-store
     Pragma: no-cache

     {
      "access_token": "TlBN45jURg",
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "refresh_token": "9yNOxJtZa5",
      "expires_in": 3600
     }

2.3.2.  Refresh Token Error Response

   If the Refresh Token Request is invalid or unauthorized, the
   Authorization Server returns the Token Error Response as defined in
   Section 5.2 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].

2.4.  UserInfo Endpoint

   The UserInfo Endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource that returns
   Claims about the authenticated End-User.  To obtain the requested
   Claims about the End-User, the Client makes a "GET" or "POST" request
   to the UserInfo Endpoint.  These Claims are represented by a JSON
   object that contains a collection of name and value pairs for the
   Claims.

   Communication with the UserInfo Endpoint MUST utilize TLS.  See
   Section 11.16 for more information on using TLS.

   The UserInfo Endpoint MUST support the use of the HTTP "GET" and HTTP
   "POST" methods defined in RFC 2616 [RFC2616] at the UserInfo
   Endpoint.

   The UserInfo Endpoint MUST accept Access Tokens as OAuth 2.0 Bearer



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 33]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   Token Usage [RFC6750].

   The UserInfo Endpoint SHOULD support the use of Cross Origin Resource
   Sharing (CORS) [CORS] and or other methods as appropriate to enable
   Java Script Clients to access the endpoint.

2.4.1.  UserInfo Request

   Clients send requests with the following parameters to the UserInfo
   Endpoint to obtain Claims about the End-User:

   access_token  REQUIRED.  Access Token obtained from an OpenID Connect
      Authorization Request.

   The Client sends the UserInfo Request using either HTTPS "GET" or
   HTTPS "POST".  It is RECOMMENDED that the Client use the
   "Authorization" header field method for all requests and that they
   use the "GET" method.

   The Access Token obtained from an OpenID Connect Authorization
   Request MUST be sent as a Bearer Token.  Section 2 of the OAuth 2.0
   Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750] specification documents the permissible
   methods of sending the Access Token.

   The following is a non-normative example of a UserInfo request:

     GET /userinfo HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Authorization: Bearer SlAV32hkKG

2.4.2.  UserInfo Response

   The UserInfo Claims MUST be returned as the members of a JSON object
   unless a signed or encrypted response was requested during Client
   Registration.  The Claims defined in Section 2.6 can be returned, as
   can additional Claims not specified there.

   If a Claim is not returned, that Claim Name SHOULD be omitted from
   the JSON object representing the Claims; it SHOULD NOT be present
   with a null or empty string value.

   The "sub" (subject) Claim MUST always be returned in the UserInfo
   Response.

   NOTE: The UserInfo Endpoint response is not guaranteed to be about
   the End-User identified by the "sub" (subject) element of the ID
   Token.  The "sub" Claim in the UserInfo Endpoint response MUST be
   verified to exactly match the "sub" Claim in the ID Token before



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 34]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   using additional UserInfo Endpoint Claims.

   Upon receipt of the UserInfo request, the UserInfo Endpoint MUST
   return the JSON Serialization of the UserInfo response as in
   Section 8.3 in the HTTP response body unless a different format was
   specified during Registration [OpenID.Registration].  The content-
   type of the HTTP response MUST be set to "application/json" if the
   response body is a text JSON structure; the response body SHOULD be
   encoded using UTF-8.  If the JSON response is signed or encrypted,
   then the content-type MUST be set to "application/jwt".

   Upon receipt of the UserInfo Response, the Client MUST verify the
   response in accordance with Section 4.4.

   The following is a non-normative example of a UserInfo Response:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: application/json

     {
      "sub": "248289761001",
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "given_name": "Jane",
      "family_name": "Doe",
      "email": "janedoe@example.com",
      "picture": "http://example.com/janedoe/me.jpg"
     }

2.4.3.  UserInfo Error Response

   When an error condition occurs, the UserInfo Endpoint returns an
   Error Response as defined in Section 3 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token
   Usage [RFC6750].

   The following is a non-normative example of a UserInfo Error
   Response:

     HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
     WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="example.com",
                          error="invalid_token",
                          error_description="The Access Token expired"

2.5.  Scope Values

   OpenID Connect Clients use "scope" values as defined in 3.3 of OAuth
   2.0 [RFC6749] to specify what access privileges are being requested
   for Access Tokens.  The scopes associated with Access Tokens
   determine what resources will be available when they are used to



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 35]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   access OAuth 2.0 protected endpoints.  For OpenID Connect, scopes can
   be used to request that specific sets of information be made
   available as Claim Values.  This specification describes only the
   scope values used by OpenID Connect.

   OpenID Connect allows additional scope values to be defined and used.
   Scope values used that are not understood by an implementation SHOULD
   be ignored.

   Claims requested by the following scopes are treated by Authorization
   Servers as Voluntary Claims.

   OpenID Connect defines the following "scope" values:

   openid  REQUIRED.  Informs the Authorization Server that the Client
      is making an OpenID Connect request.  If the "openid" scope value
      is not present, the behavior is entirely unspecified.

   profile  OPTIONAL.  This scope value requests access to the End-
      User's default profile Claims, which are: "name", "family_name",
      "given_name", "middle_name", "nickname", "preferred_username",
      "profile", "picture", "website", "gender", "birthdate",
      "zoneinfo", "locale", and "updated_at".

   email  OPTIONAL.  This scope value requests access to the "email" and
      "email_verified" Claims.

   address  OPTIONAL.  This scope value requests access to the "address"
      Claim.

   phone  OPTIONAL.  This scope value requests access to the
      "phone_number" and "phone_number_verified" Claims.

   offline_access  OPTIONAL.  This scope value requests that an OAuth
      2.0 Refresh Token be issued that can be used to obtain an Access
      Token that grants access to the End-User's UserInfo Endpoint even
      when the End-User is not present (not logged in).

   Multiple scope values MAY be used by creating a space delimited, case
   sensitive list of ASCII scope values.

   The Claims requested by the "profile", "email", "address", and
   "phone" scope values are returned from the UserInfo Endpoint, as
   described in Section 2.4.2, when a "response_type" value is used that
   results in an Access Token being issued.  However, when the
   "response_type" value used is "id_token" (which issues no Access
   Token), the resulting Claims are returned in the ID Token.

   In some cases, the End-User will be given the option to have the
   OpenID Provider decline to provide some or all information requested
   by Clients.  To minimize the amount of information that the End-User
   is being asked to disclose, a Client can elect to only request a
   subset of the information available from the UserInfo Endpoint.

   The following is a non-normative example of a "scope" Request:

     scope=openid profile email phone

2.6.  Standard Claims

   This specification defines a set of standard Claims.  They can be
   requested to be returned either in the UserInfo Response or in the ID
   Token.

   |                       |         | affirmative steps to ensure     |
   |                       |         | that this phone number was      |
   |                       |         | controlled by the End-User at   |

   For privacy reasons, OpenID Providers MAY elect to not return values
   for some requested Claims.

   The "sub" (subject) Claim in the UserInfo Endpoint response MUST
   exactly match the "sub" Claim in the ID Token, before using
   additional UserInfo Endpoint Claims.

   The UserInfo Endpoint MUST return Claims in JSON format unless a
   different format was specified during Registration
   [OpenID.Registration].  The UserInfo Endpoint MAY return Claims in

   JWT format, which can be signed and/or encrypted.  The UserInfo
   Endpoint MUST return a content-type header to indicate which format
   is being returned.  The following are accepted content types:

               +------------------+------------------------+
               | Content-Type     | Format Returned        |
               +------------------+------------------------+
               | application/json | plain text JSON object |
               +------------------+------------------------+
               | application/jwt  | JSON Web Token (JWT)   |
               +------------------+------------------------+

   The following is a non-normative example of a UserInfo Response body:

     {
      "sub": "248289761001",
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "given_name": "Jane",
      "family_name": "Doe",
      "preferred_username": "j.doe",
      "email": "janedoe@example.com",
      "picture": "http://example.com/janedoe/me.jpg"
     }

2.6.1.  Address Claim

   The Address Claim represents a physical mailing address.
   Implementations MAY return only a subset of the fields of an
   "address", depending upon the information available and the End-
   User's privacy preferences.  For example, the "country" and "region"
   might be returned without returning more fine-grained address
   information.

   Implementations MAY return just the full address as a single string
   in the formatted sub-field, or they MAY return just the individual
   component fields using the other sub-fields, or they MAY return both.
   If both variants are returned, they SHOULD be describing the same
   address, with the formatted address indicating how the component
   fields are combined.

   formatted  Full mailing address, formatted for display or use on a
      mailing label.  This field MAY contain multiple lines, separated
      by newline characters.

   street_address  Full street address component, which MAY include
      house number, street name, Post Office Box, and multi-line
      extended street address information.  This field MAY contain
      multiple lines, separated by newline characters.

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   locality  City or locality component.

   region  State, province, prefecture or region component.

   postal_code  Zip code or postal code component.

   country  Country name component.

2.6.2.  Claims Languages and Scripts

   Human-readable Claim Values and Claim Values that reference human-
   readable values MAY be represented in multiple languages and scripts.
   To specify the languages and scripts, BCP47 [RFC5646] language tags
   are added to member names, delimited by a "#" character.  For
   example, "family_name#ja-Kana-JP" expresses the Family Name in
   Katakana in Japanese, which is commonly used to index and represent
   the phonetics of the Kanji representation of the same represented as
   "family_name#ja-Hani-JP".  As another example, both "website" and
   "website#de" Claim Values might be returned, referencing a Web site
   in an unspecified language and a Web site in German.

   Since Claim Names are case sensitive, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that
   language tag values used in Claim Names be spelled using the
   character case with which they are registered in the IANA Language
   Subtag Registry [IANA.Language].  In particular, normally language
   names are spelled with lowercase characters, region names are spelled
   with uppercase characters, and scripts are spelled with mixed case
   characters.  However, since BCP47 language tag values are case
   insensitive, implementations SHOULD interpret the language tag values
   supplied in a case insensitive manner.

   Per the recommendations in BCP47, language tag values for Claims
   SHOULD only be as specific as necessary.  For instance, using "fr"
   might be sufficient in many contexts, rather than "fr-CA" or "fr-FR".
   Where possible, OPs SHOULD try to match requested Claim locales with
   Claims it has.  For instance, if the Client asks for a Claim with a
   "de" (German) language tag and the OP has a value tagged with "de-CH"
   (Swiss German) and no generic German value, it would be appropriate
   for the OP to return the Swiss German value to the Client.  (This
   intentionally moves as much of the complexity of language tag
   matching to the OP as possible, to simplify Clients.)

   A "claims_locales" request can be used to specify the preferred
   languages and scripts to use for the returned Claims.  Section 2.7.2
   describes how to request that specific Claims use particular
   languages and scripts.

   When the OP determines, either through the "claims_locales"



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 44]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   parameter, or by other means, that the End-User and Client are
   requesting Claims in only one set of languages and scripts, it is
   RECOMMENDED that OPs return Claims without language tags when they
   employ this language and script.  It is also RECOMMENDED that Clients
   be written in a manner that they can handle and utilize Claims using
   language tags.

2.6.3.  Claim Stability and Uniqueness

   The "sub" (subject) and "iss" (issuer) Claims are the only Claims
   that a Client can rely upon as a stable identifier for the End-User,
   since the "sub" Claim MUST be locally unique and never reassigned
   within the Issuer for a particular End-User, as described in
   Section 2.1.5.1.  Therefore, the only guaranteed unique identifier
   for a given End-User is the combination of the "iss" Claim and the
   "sub" Claim.

   All other Claims carry no such guarantees across different issuers in
   terms of stability over time or uniqueness across users, and Issuers
   are permitted to apply local restrictions and policies.  For
   instance, an Issuer MAY re-use an "email" Claim value across
   different End-Users at different points in time, and the claimed
   "email" address for a given End-User MAY change over time.
   Therefore, other Claims such as "email", "phone_number", and
   "preferred_username" and MUST NOT be used as unique identifiers for
   the End-User.

2.6.4.  Additional Claims

   While this specification defines only small set of Claims as standard
   Claims, other Claims MAY be used in conjunction with the standard
   Claims.  When using such Claims, it is RECOMMENDED that collision
   resistant names be used for the Claim Names, as described in Section
   4.2 (Public Claim Names) of the JSON Web Token (JWT) [JWT]
   specification.  Alternatively, Private Claim Names can be safely used
   when naming conflicts are unlikely to arise, as described in 4.3 of
   the JWT specification.  Or, if specific additional Claims will have
   broad and general applicability, they can be registered with Reserved
   Claim Names, per Sections 4.1 and 9.1 of the JWT specification.

2.7.  Claims Request

   The "claims" parameter requests that specific Claims be returned from
   the UserInfo Endpoint and/or in the ID Token.  It is represented as a
   JSON object containing lists of Claims being requested from these
   locations.  Properties of the Claims being requested MAY also be
   specified.




Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 45]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   Support for the "claims" parameter is OPTIONAL.  Should an OP not
   support this parameter and an RP uses it, the OP SHOULD return a set
   of Claims to the RP that it believes would be useful to the RP and
   the End-User using whatever heuristics it believes are appropriate.
   The "claims_parameter_supported" Discovery result indicates whether
   the OP supports this parameter.

   The "claims" parameter value is represented in an OAuth 2.0 request
   as UTF-8 encoded JSON (which ends up being form-urlencoded when
   passed as an OAuth parameter).  When used in a Request Object value,
   per Section 2.10.1, the JSON is used as the value of the "claims"
   member.

   The top-level members of the Claims request JSON object are:

   userinfo  OPTIONAL.  Requests that the listed individual Claims be
      returned from the UserInfo Endpoint.  If present, the listed
      Claims are being requested to be added to any Claims that are
      being requested using "scope" values.  If not present, the Claims
      being requested from the UserInfo Endpoint are only those
      requested using "scope" values.

      When the "userinfo" member is used, the request MUST also use a
      "response_type" value that results in an Access Token being issued
      to use at the UserInfo Endpoint.

   id_token  OPTIONAL.  Requests that the listed individual Claims be
      returned in the ID Token.  If present, the listed Claims are being
      requested to be added to the default Claims in the ID Token.  If
      not present, the default ID Token Claims are requested.

   Other members MAY be present.  Any members used that are not
   understood MUST be ignored.


















Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 46]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   An example Claims request is as follows:

     {
      "userinfo":
       {
        "given_name": {"essential": true},
        "nickname": null,
        "email": {"essential": true},
        "email_verified": {"essential": true},
        "picture": null,
        "http://example.info/claims/groups": null
       },
      "id_token":
       {
        "auth_time": {"essential": true},
        "acr": {"values": ["urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver"] }
       }
     }

   Note that a Claim that is not in the standard set defined in
   Section 2.6, the (example) "http://example.info/claims/groups" Claim,
   is being requested.  Using the "claims" parameter is the only way to
   request Claims outside the standard set.  It is also the only way to
   request specific combinations of the standard Claims that cannot be
   specified using scope values.

2.7.1.  Individual Claims Requests

   The "userinfo" and "id_token" members of the "claims" request both
   are JSON objects with the names of the individual Claims being
   requested as the member names.  The member values MUST be one of the
   following:

   null  Indicates that this Claim is being requested in the default
      manner.  In particular, this is a Voluntary Claim.  For instance,
      the Claim request:

     "given_name": null

      requests the "given_name" Claim in the default manner.

   JSON Object  Used to provide additional information about the Claim
      being requested.  This specification defines the following
      members:







Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 47]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


      essential  OPTIONAL.  Indicates whether the Claim being requested
         is an Essential Claim.  If the value is "true", this indicates
         that the Claim is an Essential Claim.  For instance, the Claim
         request:

     "auth_time": {"essential": true}

         can be used to specify that it is Essential to return an
         "auth_time" Claim Value.

         If the value is "false", it indicates that it is a Voluntary
         Claim.  The default is "false".

         By requesting Claims as Essential Claims the Client indicates
         to the End-User that releasing these Claims will ensure a
         smooth authorization for the specific task requested by the
         End-User.  Note that even if the Claims are not available
         because the End-User did not authorize their release or they
         are not present, the Authorization Server MUST NOT generate an
         error when Claims are not returned, whether they are Essential
         or Voluntary.

      value  OPTIONAL.  Requests that the Claim be returned with a
         particular value.  For instance the Claim request:

     "sub": {"value": "248289761001"}

         can be used to specify that the request apply to the End-User
         with subject identifier "248289761001".

         The value of the "value" member MUST be a valid value for the
         Claim being requested.  Definitions of individual Claims can
         include requirements on how and whether the "value" qualifier
         is to be used when requesting that Claim.

      values  OPTIONAL.  Requests that the Claim be returned with one of
         a set of values, with the values appearing in order of
         preference.  For instance the Claim request:

     "acr": {"essential": true,
             "values": ["urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver",
                        "urn:mace:incommon:iap:bronze"]}

         specifies that it is Essential that the "acr" Claim be returned
         with either the value "urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver" or
         "urn:mace:incommon:iap:bronze".





Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 48]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


         The values in the "values" member array MUST be valid values
         for the Claim being requested.  Definitions of individual
         Claims can include requirements on how and whether the "values"
         qualifier is to be used when requesting that Claim.

      Other members MAY be defined to provide additional information
      about the requested Claims.  Any members used that are not
      understood MUST be ignored.

   Note that when the "claims" request parameter is supported, the scope
   values that request Claims, as defined in Section 2.5, are
   effectively shorthand methods for requesting sets of individual
   Claims.  For example, using the scope value "openid email" and a
   "response_type" that returns an Access Token is equivalent to using
   the scope value "openid" and the following request for individual
   Claims.

   Equivalent of using the "email" scope value:

     {
      "userinfo":
       {
        "email": null,
        "email_verified": null
       }
     }

2.7.2.  Languages and Scripts for Individual Claims

   As described in Section 2.6.2, human-readable Claims values and Claim
   Values that reference human-readable values MAY be represented in
   multiple languages and scripts.  Within a request for individual
   Claims, requested languages and scripts for particular Claims MAY be
   requested by including Claim Names that contain "#"-separated BCP47
   [RFC5646] language tags in the Claims request, using the Claim Name
   syntax specified in Section 2.6.2.  For example, a Family Name in
   Katakana in Japanese can be requested using the Claim Name
   "family_name#ja-Kana-JP" and a Kanji representation of the Family
   Name in Japanese can be requested using the Claim Name
   "family_name#ja-Hani-JP".  A German-language Web site can be
   requested with the Claim Name "website#de".

   If an OP receives a request for human-readable Claims in a language
   and script that it doesn't have, any versions of those Claims
   returned that don't use the requested language and script SHOULD use
   a language tag in the Claim Name.

2.8.  Claim Types

   The UserInfo Endpoint MAY return the following three types of Claims:

   Normal Claims  Claims that are directly asserted by the OpenID
      Provider.

   Aggregated Claims  Claims that are asserted by a Claims Provider
      other than the OpenID Provider but are returned by OpenID
      Provider.

   Distributed Claims  Claims that are asserted by a Claims Provider
      other than the OpenID Provider but are returned as references by
      the OpenID Provider.

   The UserInfo Endpoint MUST support Normal Claims.

   Aggregated and Distributed Claims support is OPTIONAL.

2.8.1.  Normal Claims

   Normal Claims are represented as members in a JSON object.  The Claim
   Name is the member name and the Claim Value is the member value.

   The following is a non-normative response containing Normal Claims:

     {
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "given_name": "Jane",
      "family_name": "Doe",
      "email": "janedoe@example.com",
      "picture": "http://example.com/janedoe/me.jpg"
     }

2.8.2.  Aggregated and Distributed Claims

   Aggregated and distributed Claims are represented by using special
   "_claim_names" and "_claim_sources" members of the JSON object
   containing the Claims.

   _claim_names  JSON object whose member names are the Claim Names for
      the Aggregated and Distributed Claims.  The member values are
      references to the member names in the "_claim_sources" member from
      which the actual Claim Values can be retrieved.







Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 50]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   _claim_sources  JSON object whose member names are referenced by the
      member values of the "_claim_names" member.  The member values
      contain sets of Aggregated Claims or reference locations for
      Distributed Claims.  The member values can have one of the
      following formats depending on whether it is providing Aggregated
      or Distributed Claims:

      Aggregated Claims  JSON object that MUST contain the "JWT" member
         whose value is a JWT [JWT] that MUST contain all the Claims in
         the "_claim_names" object that references the corresponding
         "_claim_sources" member.  Other members MAY be present.  Any
         members used that are not understood MUST be ignored.

         JWT  REQUIRED.  JWT containing Claim Values.

         The JWT SHOULD NOT contain a "sub" (subject) Claim unless its
         value is an identifier for the End-User at the Claims Provider
         (and not for the OpenID Provider or another party); this
         typically means that a "sub" Claim SHOULD NOT be provided.

      Distributed Claims  JSON object that contains the following
         members and values:

         endpoint  REQUIRED.  OAuth 2.0 resource endpoint from which the
            associated Claim can be retrieved.  The endpoint URL MUST
            return the Claim as a JWT.

         access_token  OPTIONAL.  Access Token enabling retrieval of the
            Claims from the endpoint URL by using the OAuth 2.0 Bearer
            Token Usage [RFC6750] protocol.  Claims SHOULD be requested
            using the Authorization Request header field and Claims
            Providers MUST support this method.  If the Access Token is
            not available, Clients MAY need to retrieve the Access Token
            out of band or use an a priori Access Token that was
            negotiated between the Claims Provider and Client, or the
            Claims Provider MAY reauthenticate the End-User and/or
            reauthorize the Client.

         A "sub" (subject) Claim SHOULD NOT be returned from the Claims
         Provider unless its value is an identifier for the End-User at
         the Claims Provider (and not for the OpenID Provider or another
         party); this typically means that a "sub" Claim SHOULD NOT be
         provided.

2.8.2.1.  Example of Aggregated Claims

   In this non-normative example, Claims from Claims Provider A are
   combined with other Claims held by the OpenID provider, with the
   Claims from Claims Provider A being returned as Aggregated Claims.

   In this example, these Claims about Jane Doe have been issued by
   Claims Provider A:

     {
      "address": {
        "street_address": "1234 Hollywood Blvd.",
        "locality": "Los Angeles",
        "region": "CA",
        "postal_code": "90210",
        "country": "US"},
      "phone_number": "+1 (310) 123-4567"
     }

   Claims Provider A signs the JSON Claims, representing them in a
   signed JWT: jwt_header.jwt_part2.jwt_part3.  It is this JWT that is
   used by the OpenID Provider.

   In this example, this JWT containing Jane Doe's Aggregated Claims
   from Claims Provider A is combined with other Normal Claims, and
   returned as the following set of Claims:

     {
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "given_name": "Jane",
      "family_name": "Doe",
      "birthdate": "0000-03-22",
      "eye_color": "blue",
      "email": "janedoe@example.com",
      "_claim_names": {
        "address": "src1",
        "phone_number": "src1"
      },
      "_claim_sources": {
        "src1": {"JWT": "jwt_header.jwt_part2.jwt_part3"}
      }
     }

2.8.2.2.  Example of Distributed Claims

   In this non-normative example, the OpenID Provider combines Normal
   Claims that it holds with references to Claims held by two different
   Claims Providers, B and C, incorporating references to some of the



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 52]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   Claims held by B and C as Distributed Claims.

   In this example, these Claims about Jane Doe are held by Claims
   Provider B (Jane Doe's bank):

     {
      "shipping_address": {
        "street_address": "1234 Hollywood Blvd.",
        "locality": "Los Angeles",
        "region": "CA",
        "postal_code": "90210",
        "country": "US"},
      "payment_info": "Some_Card 1234 5678 9012 3456",
      "phone_number": "+1 (310) 123-4567"
     }

   Also in this example, this Claim about Jane Doe is held by Claims
   Provider C (a credit agency):

     {
      "credit_score": 650
     }

   The OpenID Provider returns Jane Doe's Claims along with references
   to the Distributed Claims from Claims Provider B and Claims Provider
   C by sending the Access Tokens and URLs of locations from which the
   Distributed Claims can be retrieved:

     {
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "given_name": "Jane",
      "family_name": "Doe",
      "email": "janedoe@example.com",
      "birthdate": "0000-03-22",

        "shipping_address": "src1",
        "credit_score": "src2"
       },
      "_claim_sources": {
        "src1": {"endpoint":

      }

2.9.  Subject Identifier Types

   The OpenID Provider's Discovery document SHOULD list its supported
   identifier types in the "subject_types_supported" element.  If there
   is more than one type listed in the array, the Client MAY elect to
   provide its preferred identifier type using the "subject_type"
   parameter during Registration.  The types supported by this
   specification are:

   public  This provides the same "sub" (subject) value to all Clients.
      It is the default if the provider has no "subject_types_supported"
      element in its discovery document.

   pairwise  This provides a different "sub" value to each Client, to
      prevent correlation of the End-User's activities by Clients
      without his permission.

2.9.1.  Pairwise Identifier Algorithm

   The OpenID Provider MUST calculate a unique "sub" (subject) value for
   each Sector Identifier.  The subject value MUST NOT be reversible by
   any party other than the OpenID Provider.

   Providers who use pairwise "sub" values SHOULD support the
   "sector_identifier_uri" in Dynamic Client Registration
   [OpenID.Registration].  It provides a way for a group of websites
   under common administrative control to have consistent pairwise "sub"
   values independent of the individual domain names.  It also provides
   a way for Clients to change "redirect_uri" domains without having to
   reregister all of their users.

   If the Client has not provided a value for "sector_identifier_uri" in
   Dynamic Client Registration [OpenID.Registration], the Sector
   Identifier used for pairwise identifier calculation is the host
   component of the registered "redirect_uri".  If there are multiple
   hostnames in the registered "redirect_uris", the Client MUST register
   a "sector_identifier_uri".

   When a "sector_identifier_uri" is provided, the host component of
   that URL is used as the Sector Identifier for the pairwise identifier
   calculation.  The value of the "sector_identifier_uri" MUST be a URL
   using the "https" scheme that points to a JSON file containing an
   array of "redirect_uri" values.  The values of the registered
   "redirect_uris" MUST be included in the elements of the array, or the
   registration MUST fail.

   A number of algorithms can be used by OpenID Providers to calculate
   pairwise identifiers.  Three example methods are:



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 54]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   1.  The Sector Identifier can be concatenated with a local account ID
       and a salt value that is kept secret by the Provider.  The
       concatenated string is then hashed using an appropriate
       algorithm.

       Calculate "sub" = SHA-256 ( sector_identifier | local_account_id
       | salt ).


   2.  The Sector Identifier can be concatenated with a local account ID
       and a salt value that is kept secret by the Provider.  The
       concatenated string is then encrypted using an appropriate
       algorithm.

       Calculate "sub" = AES-128 ( sector_identifier | local_account_id
       | salt ).


   3.  The Issuer creates a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) for the
       pair of Sector Identifier and local account ID and stores this
       value.

2.10.  Passing Authorization Request Parameters as JWTs

   This specification defines the "request" and "request_uri" OAuth 2.0
   extension parameters to enable Authentication Requests to be signed
   and optionally encrypted.  Requests using these parameters are
   represented as JWTs, which are respectively passed by value or by
   reference.  The ability to pass requests by reference is particularly
   useful for large requests.  If one of these parameters is used, the
   other MUST NOT be used in the same request.

2.10.1.  Passing a Request Object by Value

   The "request" parameter enables OpenID Connect requests to be passed
   in a single, self-contained parameter and to be signed and optionally
   encrypted.  It represents the request as a JWT whose Claims are the
   request parameters specified in Section 2.1.2.1.  This JWT is called
   a Request Object.

   Support for the "request" parameter is OPTIONAL.  The
   "request_parameter_supported" Discovery result indicates whether the
   OP supports this parameter.  Should an OP not support this parameter
   and an RP uses it, the OP MUST return the "request_not_supported"
   error.

   When the "request" parameter is used, the OpenID Connect request
   parameter values contained in the JWT supersede those passed using



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 55]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   the OAuth 2.0 request syntax.  However, some parameters MAY be passed
   using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax even when a Request Object is
   used; this would typically be done to enable a cached, pre-signed
   (and possibly pre-encrypted) Request Object value to be used
   containing the fixed request parameters, while parameters that can
   vary with each request, such as "state" and "nonce", are passed as
   OAuth 2.0 parameters.

   Even if a "scope" parameter is present in the Request Object value, a
   "scope" parameter MUST always be passed using the OAuth 2.0 request
   syntax containing the "openid" scope value to indicate to the
   underlying OAuth 2.0 logic that this is an OpenID Connect request.

   The Request Object MAY be signed or unsigned (plaintext).  When it is
   plaintext, this is indicated by use of the "none" algorithm [JWA] in
   the JWS header.  If signed, the Request Object SHOULD contain the
   Claims "iss" (issuer) and "aud" (audience) as members, with their
   semantics being as defined in the JWT [JWT] specification.

   The Request Object MAY also be encrypted using JWE [JWE], with nested
   signing and encryption performed as described in the JWT [JWT]
   specification.

   "request" and "request_uri" parameters MUST NOT be included in
   Request Objects.

2.10.2.  Passing a Request Object by Reference

   The "request_uri" parameter enables OpenID Connect requests to be
   passed by reference, rather than by value.  This parameter is used
   identically to the "request" parameter, other than that the Request
   Object value is retrieved from the resource at the specified URL,
   rather than passed by value.

   The "request_uri_parameter_supported" Discovery result indicates
   whether the OP supports this parameter.  Should an OP not support
   this parameter and an RP uses it, the OP MUST return the
   "request_uri_not_supported" error.

   When the "request_uri" parameter is used, the OpenID Connect request
   parameter values contained in the referenced JWT supersede those
   passed using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax.  However, some parameters
   MAY be passed using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax even when a
   "request_uri" is used; this would typically be done to enable a

   cached, pre-signed (and possibly pre-encrypted) Request Object value
   to be used containing the fixed request parameters, while parameters
   that can vary with each request, such as "state" and "nonce", are
   passed as OAuth 2.0 parameters.

   Even if a "scope" parameter is present in the referenced Request
   Object, a "scope" parameter MUST always be passed using the OAuth 2.0
   request syntax containing the "openid" scope value to indicate to the
   underlying OAuth 2.0 logic that this is an OpenID Connect request.

   Servers MAY cache the contents of the resources referenced by Request
   URIs.  If the contents of the referenced resource could ever change,
   the URI SHOULD include the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash of the
   referenced resource contents as the fragment component of the URI.
   If the fragment value used for a URI changes, that signals the server
   that any cached value for that URI with the old fragment value is no
   longer valid.

   Note that Clients MAY pre-register "request_uri" values using the
   "request_uris" parameter defined in Section 2 of the OpenID Connect
   Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 [OpenID.Registration] specification.
   OPs can require that "request_uri" values used be pre-registered with
   the "require_request_uri_registration" discovery parameter.

   The entire Request URI MUST NOT exceed 512 ASCII characters.

   The contents of the resource referenced by the URL MUST be a Request
   Object.  The scheme used in the "request_uri" value MUST be "https",
   unless the target Request Object is signed in a way that is
   verifiable by the Authorization Server.  The "request_uri" value MUST
   be reachable by the Authorization Server, and SHOULD be reachable by
   the Client.

2.10.2.1.  Client Generates the URL of the Request Object

   The Client stores the Request Object resource either locally or
   remotely at a URL the Server can access.  This is the Request URI,
   "request_uri".

   If the Request Object includes attribute values, it MUST NOT be
   revealed to anybody but the Authorization Server.  As such, the
   "request_uri" MUST have appropriate entropy for its lifetime.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that it be removed if it is known that it will not be
   used again or after a reasonable timeout unless access control
   measures are taken.

   The following is a non-normative example of a Request URI value (with
   line wraps within values for display purposes only):

     https://client.example.org/request.jwt#
       GkurKxf5T0Y-mnPFCHqWOMiZi4VS138cQO_V7PZHAdM

2.10.2.2.  Client Sends Request using "request_uri" Parameter

   The Client sends the Authorization Request to the Authorization
   Endpoint.

   The following is a non-normative example of an Authorization Request
   using the "request_uri" parameter (with line wraps within values for
   display purposes only):

     https://server.example.com/authorize?
       response_type=code%20id_token
       &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
       &request_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Frequest.jwt
       %23GkurKxf5T0Y-mnPFCHqWOMiZi4VS138cQO_V7PZHAdM
       &state=af0ifjsldkj&nonce=n-0S6_WzA2Mj
       &scope=openid

2.10.2.3.  Authorization Server Fetches Request Object

   Upon receipt of the Request, the Authorization Server MUST send a
   "GET" request to the "request_uri" to retrieve the content unless it
   is already cached and parse it to recreate the Authorization Request
   parameters.

   Note that the RP SHOULD use a unique URI for each request utilizing
   distinct parameters, or otherwise prevent the Authorization Server
   from caching the "request_uri".

   The following is a non-normative example of this fetch process:

     GET /request.jwt HTTP/1.1
     Host: client.example.org

2.10.2.4.  "request_uri" Rationale

   There are several reasons that one might choose to use the
   "request_uri" parameter:

   1.  The set of request parameters can become large, and can exceed
       browser URI size limitations.  Passing the request parameters by
       reference can solve this problem.

   2.  Passing a "request_uri" value, rather than a complete request by
       value, can reduce request latency.

   3.  Most requests for Claims from an RP are constant.  The
       "request_uri" is a way of creating and sometimes also signing and
       encrypting a constant set of request parameters in advance.  (The
       "request_uri" value becomes an "artifact" representing a
       particular fixed set of request parameters.)

   4.  Pre-registering a fixed set of request parameters at registration
       time enables OPs to cache and pre-validate the request parameters

       at registration time, meaning they need not be retrieved at
       request time.

   5.  Pre-registering a fixed set of request parameters at registration
       time enables OPs to vet the contents of the request from consumer
       protection and other points of views, either itself or by
       utilizing a third party.

3.  Signatures and Encryption

   Depending on the transport through which the messages are sent, the
   integrity of the message might not be guaranteed and the originator
   of the message might not be authenticated.  To mitigate these risks,
   Request Object, Token Request, ID Token, and UserInfo Response values
   MAY utilize JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS] to sign the contents.

   To achieve message confidentiality, Request Object, Token Request, ID
   Token, and UserInfo Response values MAY use JSON Web Encryption (JWE)
   [JWE] to encrypt the content.

   When the message is both signed and encrypted, it MUST be signed
   first and then encrypted, per Section 11.13, with nesting performed
   in the same manner as specified for JWTs [JWT].  Note that all JWE
   encryption methods perform integrity checking.

3.1.  Supported Algorithms

   The server advertises its supported signing and encryption algorithms
   in its discovery document.  The algorithm identifiers are specified
   in JWA [JWA].  The related elements are:

   userinfo_signing_alg_values_supported  JSON array containing a list
      of the JWS [JWS] signing algorithms ("alg" values) [JWA] supported
      by the UserInfo Endpoint to encode the Claims in a JWT [JWT].

   userinfo_encryption_alg_values_supported  JSON array containing a
      list of the JWE [JWE] encryption algorithms ("alg" values) [JWA]
      supported by the UserInfo Endpoint to encode the Claims in a JWT
      [JWT].

   userinfo_encryption_enc_values_supported  JSON array containing a
      list of the JWE encryption algorithms ("enc" values) [JWA]
      supported by the UserInfo Endpoint to encode the Claims in a JWT
      [JWT].

   id_token_signing_alg_values_supported  JSON array containing a list
      of the JWS signing algorithms ("alg" values) supported by the
      Authorization Server for the ID Token to encode the Claims in a
      JWT [JWT].

   id_token_encryption_alg_values_supported  JSON array containing a
      list of the JWE encryption algorithms ("alg" values) supported by
      the Authorization Server for the ID Token to encode the Claims in
      a JWT [JWT].





Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 64]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   id_token_encryption_enc_values_supported  JSON array containing a
      list of the JWE encryption algorithms ("enc" values) supported by
      the Authorization Server for the ID Token to encode the Claims in
      a JWT [JWT].

   request_object_signing_alg_values_supported  JSON array containing a
      list of the JWS signing algorithms ("alg" values) supported by the
      Authorization Server for Request Object values.  Servers SHOULD
      support "none" and "RS256".

   request_object_encryption_alg_values_supported  JSON array containing
      a list of the JWE encryption algorithms ("alg" values) supported
      by the Authorization Server for Request Object values.

   request_object_encryption_enc_values_supported  JSON array containing
      a list of the JWE encryption algorithms ("enc" values) supported
      by the Authorization Server for Request Object values.

   token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg_values_supported  JSON array
      containing a list of the JWS signing algorithms ("alg" values)
      supported by the Token Endpoint for the "private_key_jwt" and
      "client_secret_jwt" methods to encode the JWT [JWT].  Servers
      SHOULD support "RS256".

   The Client registers its REQUIRED algorithms for Signing and
   Encryption using the following Registration parameters:

   request_object_signing_alg  OPTIONAL.  JWS signature algorithm [JWA]
      REQUIRED for Request Objects by the Authorization Server.  All
      Request Objects from this "client_id" MUST be rejected if not
      signed by this algorithm.  Servers SHOULD support "RS256".

   userinfo_signed_response_alg  OPTIONAL.  JWS signature algorithm
      [JWA] REQUIRED for UserInfo Responses.  If this is specified the
      response will be JWT [JWT] serialized.

   userinfo_encrypted_response_alg  OPTIONAL.  JWE "alg" algorithm [JWA]
      REQUIRED for UserInfo Responses.  If this is requested in
      combination with signing, the response MUST be signed first then
      encrypted, per Section 11.13.  If this is specified, the response
      will be JWT [JWT] serialized.

   userinfo_encrypted_response_enc  OPTIONAL.  JWE "enc" algorithm [JWA]
      REQUIRED for UserInfo Responses.  If
      "userinfo_encrypted_response_alg" is specified the default for
      this value is "A128CBC-HS256".





Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 65]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   id_token_signed_response_alg  OPTIONAL.  JWS signature algorithm
      [JWA] REQUIRED for ID Tokens issued to this "client_id".  The
      default if not specified is "RS256".  The public key for
      validating the signature is provided by retrieving the JWK Set
      referenced by the "jwks_uri" element from Discovery.

   id_token_encrypted_response_alg  OPTIONAL.  JWE "alg" algorithm [JWA]
      REQUIRED for ID Tokens issued to this "client_id".  If this is
      requested, the response MUST be signed then encrypted.  The
      default if not specified is no encryption.

   id_token_encrypted_response_enc  OPTIONAL.  JWE "enc" algorithm [JWA]
      REQUIRED for ID Tokens issued to this "client_id".  If
      "id_token_encrypted_response_alg" is specified the default for
      this value is "A128CBC-HS256".

3.2.  Keys

   The OpenID Provider provides its public keys during Discovery using
   the following element:

   jwks_uri  REQUIRED.  URL of the OP's JSON Web Key Set [JWK] document.
      This contains the signing key(s) the Client uses to validate
      signatures from the OP.  The JWK Set MAY also contain the Server's
      encryption key(s), which are used by Clients to encrypt requests
      to the Server.  When both signing and encryption keys are made
      available, a "use" (Key Use) parameter value is REQUIRED for all
      keys in the document to indicate each key's intended usage.

   Likewise, the Client can provide its public keys during Registration
   using the following element:

   jwks_uri  OPTIONAL.  URL for the Client's JSON Web Key Set [JWK]
      document.  If the Client signs requests to the Server, it contains
      the signing key(s) the Server uses to validate signatures from the
      Client.  The JWK Set MAY also contain the Client's encryption
      keys(s), which are used by the Server to encrypt responses to the
      Client.  When both signing and encryption keys are made available,
      a "use" (Key Use) parameter value is REQUIRED for all keys in the
      document to indicate each key's intended usage.

   When both signing and encryption keys are made available, the "use"
   (Key Use) parameter value is REQUIRED for all keys in the JWK Set at
   the "jwks_uri" to indicate each key's intended usage.  Although some
   algorithms allow the same key pair to be used for both signatures and
   encryption, doing so is NOT RECOMMENDED, as it is less secure.

   In both cases, the JWK "x5c" parameter MAY be used to provide X.509



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 66]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   representations of keys provided.  When used, the bare key values
   MUST still be present and MUST match those in the certificate.

3.3.  Signing

   The signing party MUST select a signature algorithm based on the
   supported algorithms of the recipient in Section 3.1.

   Asymmetric Signatures  When using RSA or ECDSA Signatures, the "alg"
      Claim of the JWS header MUST be set to the appropriate algorithm
      as defined in JSON Web Algorithms [JWA].  The private key MUST be
      the one associated with the Public Signing Key provided in
      Section 3.2.  If there are multiple keys in the referenced JWK
      document, a "kid" value MUST be provided in the JWS header.  The
      key usage of the respective keys MUST support signature.

   Symmetric Signatures  When using MAC-based signatures, the "alg"
      Claim of the JWS header MUST be set to a MAC algorithm, as defined
      in JSON Web Algorithms [JWA].  The MAC key used is the octets of
      the UTF-8 representation of the "client_secret" value.  See
      Section 11.18 for a discussion of entropy requirements for
      "client_secret" values.  Symmetric signatures MUST never be used
      by public (non-confidential) Clients because of their inability to
      keep secrets.

   See Section 11.19 for Security Considerations about the need for
   signed requests.

3.3.1.  Rotation of Asymmetric Signing Keys

   Rotation of signing keys can be accomplished with the following
   approach.  The signer publishes its keys in a JWK Set at the
   "jwks_uri" location and includes the "kid" of the signing key in the
   JWS header of each message to indicate to the verifier which key is
   to be used to validate the signature.  Keys can be rolled over by
   periodically adding new keys to the JWK Set at "jwks_uri".  The
   signer can begin using a new key at its discretion and signals the
   change to the verifier using the "kid" value.  The verifier knows to
   go back to the "jwks_uri" to re-retrieve the keys when it sees an
   unfamiliar "kid" value.  The JWK Set document at the "jwks_uri"
   SHOULD retain recently decommissioned signing keys for a reasonable
   period of time to facilitate a smooth transition.

3.4.  Encryption

   The encrypting party MUST select an encryption algorithm based on the
   supported algorithms of the recipient in Section 3.1.  All JWTs MUST
   be signed before encryption to enable verification of the Issuer.



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 67]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   Asymmetric Encryption: RSA  Use the link registered/discovered in
      Section 3.2 to retrieve the relevant key.  If there are multiple
      keys in the referenced JWK document, a "kid" value MUST be
      provided in the JWE header.  Use the supported RSA key wrapping
      algorithm to wrap a random "Content Master Key" to be used for
      encrypting the signed JWT.  The key usage of the respective keys
      MUST include encryption.

   Asymmetric Encryption: Elliptic Curve  Create an ephemeral Elliptic
      Curve public key for the "epk" element of the JWE header.  Use the
      link registered/discovered in Section 3.2 to retrieve the relevant
      key.  If there are multiple keys in the referenced JWK document, a
      "kid" value MUST be provided in the JWE header.  Use the ECDH-ES
      algorithm to wrap a random "Content Master Key" to be used for
      encrypting the signed JWT.  The key usage of the respective keys
      MUST support encryption.

   Symmetric Encryption  The symmetric encryption key is derived from
      the "client_secret" value by using a left truncated SHA-256 hash
      of the octets of the UTF-8 representation of the "client_secret".
      The SHA-256 value MUST be left truncated to the appropriate bit
      length for the AES key wrapping algorithm used, for instance, to
      128 bits for "A128KW".  If a key wrapping key with greater than
      256 bits is needed, a different method of deriving the key from
      the "client_secret" would have to be defined by an extension.
      Symmetric encryption MUST never be used by public (non-
      confidential) Clients because of their inability to keep secrets.

   See Section 11.20 for Security Considerations about the need for
   encrypted requests.

3.4.1.  Rotation of Asymmetric Encryption Keys

   Rotating encryption keys is necessarily a different process than for
   signing keys because the encrypting party starts the process and thus
   cannot rely on a change in kid as a signal to know that keys need to
   change.  The encrypting party still uses the kid header in the JWE to
   tell the decrypting party which private key to use to decrypt,
   however, the encrypting party needs to first select the most
   appropriate key from those provided in the JWK Set at "jwks_uri".  To
   rotate keys, the decrypting party can publish new keys at "jwks_uri"
   and remove from the JWK Set those that are being decommissioned.  The
   "jwks_uri" SHOULD include a "Cache-Control" header in the response
   that contains a "max-age" directive, as defined in RFC 2616
   [RFC2616], which allows the encrypting party to safely cache the JWK
   Set and not have to re-retrieve the document for every encryption
   event.  The decrypting party SHOULD remove decommissioned keys from
   the JWK Set at "jwks_uri" but retain them internally for some

   reasonable period of time, coordinated with the cache duration, to
   facilitate a smooth transition between keys by allowing the
   encrypting party some time to obtain the new keys.  The cache
   duration SHOULD also be coordinated with the issuance of new signing
   keys as described in Section 3.3.1.

4.  Validation

   If any of the validation procedures defined in this specification
   fail, any operations requiring the information that failed to
   correctly validate MUST be aborted and the information that failed to
   validate MUST NOT be used.

4.1.  Authorization Request Validation

   Authorization Request Validation consists of two main steps: (1)
   decryption and signature validation of the value of "request" or the
   content of "request_uri", and (2) parameter validation.  If a Request
   Object value was sent in the "request" parameter or by reference in
   the "request_uri" parameter, the Request Object MUST validate as JWS
   [JWS] or JWE [JWE] encoded objects, for which nested encryption and
   signing can be utilized in the manner described in the JWT [JWT]
   specification.

4.1.1.  Encrypted Request Object

   If the Authorization Server has advertised JWE encryption algorithms
   in the "request_object_encryption_alg_values_supported" and
   "request_object_encryption_enc_values_supported" elements of its
   Discovery Document, these are used by the Client to encrypt the JWT.

   The Authorization Server MUST decode the JWT in accordance with the
   JSON Web Encryption [JWE] specification.  The result MAY be either a
   signed or unsigned (plaintext) Request Object.  In the former case,
   signature validation MUST be performed as defined in Section 4.1.2.

   The Authorization Server MUST return the error if there is a
   decryption error.

4.1.2.  Signed Request Object

   To perform Signature Validation, the "alg" parameter in the JWS
   header MUST match the value of the "request_object_signing_alg" set
   during Client Registration [OpenID.Registration] or a value that was
   pre-registered by other means.

   The signature MUST be validated against the key registered for that
   "client_id" and algorithm, in accordance with the JSON Web Signature
   [JWS] specification.

   The Authorization Server MUST return the Authorization Error Response
   if there is a signature validation error.

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


4.1.3.  Parameter Validation

   The Authorization Server MUST construct the Authorization Request
   Message from the Request Object value and the OAuth 2.0 Authorization
   Request parameters.  If the same parameter exists both in the Request
   Object and the OAuth Authorization Request parameters, the parameter
   in the Request Object is used.  Using this Authorization Request
   Message, the Authorization Server performs the following steps of the
   request validation:

   1.  The Authorization Server MUST validate all the OAuth 2.0
       parameters according to the OAuth 2.0 specification.

   2.  The Authorization Server MUST verify that all the REQUIRED
       parameters are present.

   3.  If the "sub" (subject) Claim as a member of "id_token" element is
       requested with a specific value, the Authorization Server MUST
       only send a positive response if that user has an active session
       with the Authorization Server.  The Authorization Server MUST NOT
       reply with an ID Token or Access Token for a different user, even
       if they have an active session with the Authorization Server.

   4.  If the "acr" Claim is requested as an Essential Claim for the ID
       Token with a "values" parameter requesting specific
       Authentication Context Class Reference values, then the
       Authorization Server MUST return an "acr" Claim Value that
       matches one of the requested values.  The Authorization Server
       MAY ask the End-User to re-authenticate with additional factors
       to meet this requirement.  If this is an Essential Claim and the
       requirement cannot be met, then the Authorization Server MUST
       treat that outcome as a failed authentication attempt.

   5.  The Client MAY request this Claim as a Voluntary Claim by using
       the "acr_values" request parameter or by not including
       "essential": true in the individual "acr" Claim request.  If the
       Claim is not Essential and the requested value cannot be
       provided, the Authorization Server SHOULD return the session's
       current "acr" as the value of the "acr" Claim.  If the Claim is
       not Essential, the Authorization Server is not required to
       provide this Claim in its response.

   If the Authorization Server encounters any error, it MUST return the
   error response.

4.2.  Authorization Response Validation

   The Client MUST validate the response as follows:

   Case 1: response_type=code

   1.  Validate the response according to RFC 6749, especially Sections
       4.1.2 and 10.12.

   Case 2: response_type=id_token token

   1.  Verify that the response conforms to Section 5 of
       [OAuth.Responses].

   2.  Follow the validation rules in RFC 6749, especially those in
       Sections 4.2.2 and 10.12.

   3.  Follow the validation rules in Sections 4.3 and 4.5.

   Case 3: response_type=code id_token

   1.  Verify that the response conforms to Section 5 of
       [OAuth.Responses].

   2.  Follow the validation rules in RFC 6749, especially those in
       Sections 4.2.2 and 10.12.

   3.  Follow the validation rules in Sections 4.3 and 4.6.

   Case 4: response_type=code token

   1.  Verify that the response conforms to Section 5 of

   1.  Verify that the response conforms to Section 5 of
       [OAuth.Responses].

   2.  Follow the validation rules in RFC 6749, especially those in
       Sections 4.2.2 and 10.12.

   3.  Follow the validation rules in Section 4.3.

   See Appendix A for example Authorization Requests and corresponding
   Authorization Responses for each of these cases.

4.3.  ID Token Validation

   To validate the ID Token in the Authorization or Token Endpoint
   Response, the Client MUST do the following:

   1.   If the Client has provided an "id_token_encrypted_response_alg"
        parameter during Registration, decrypt the ID Token using the
        key pair specified during Registration.

   2.   The Client MUST validate that the "aud" (audience) Claim
        contains its "client_id" value registered at the Issuer
        identified by the "iss" (issuer) Claim as an audience.  The
        "aud" (audience) Claim MAY contain an array with more than one
        element.  The ID Token MUST be rejected if the ID Token does not
        list the Client as a valid audience, or if it contains
        additional audiences not trusted by the Client.

   3.   If the ID Token contains multiple audiences, the Client SHOULD
        verify that an "azp" Claim is present.

   4.   If an "azp" (authorized party) Claim is present, the Client
        SHOULD verify and that its "client_id" is the Claim value.

   5.   If the "id_token" is received via direct communication between
        the Client and the Token Endpoint, the TLS server validation MAY
        be used to validate the issuer in place of checking the token
        signature.  The Client MUST validate the signature of all other
        ID Tokens according to JWS [JWS] using the algorithm specified
        in the "alg" parameter of the JWT header.

   6.   The "alg" value SHOULD be the default of "RS256" or the
        algorithm sent by the Client in the
        "id_token_signed_response_alg" parameter during Registration.

   7.   If the "alg" parameter of the JWT header is a MAC based
        algorithm such as "HS256", "HS384", or "HS512", the octets of
        the UTF-8 representation of the "client_secret" corresponding to



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 73]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


        the "client_id" contained in the "aud" (audience) Claim are used
        as the key to validate the signature.  Multiple audiences are
        not supported for MAC based algorithms.

   8.   For other Signing algorithms, the Client MUST use the signing
        key provided in Discovery by the Issuer.  The issuer MUST
        exactly match the value of the "iss" (issuer) Claim.

   9.   The current time MUST be less than the value of the "exp" Claim.

   10.  The "iat" Claim can be used to reject tokens that were issued
        too far away from the current time, limiting the amount of time
        that nonces need to be stored to prevent attacks.  The
        acceptable range is Client specific.

   11.  If a nonce value was sent in the Authorization Request, a
        "nonce" Claim MUST be present and its value checked to verify
        that it is the same value as the one that was sent in the
        Authorization Request.  The Client SHOULD check the "nonce"
        value for replay attacks.  The precise method for detecting
        replay attacks is Client specific.

   12.  If the "acr" Claim was requested, the Client SHOULD check that
        the asserted Claim Value is appropriate.  The meaning and
        processing of "acr" Claim Values is out of scope for this
        specification.

   13.  If the "auth_time" Claim was requested, either through a
        specific request for this Claim or by using the "max_age"
        parameter, the Client SHOULD check the "auth_time" Claim value
        and request re-authentication if it determines too much time has
        elapsed since the last End-User authentication.

4.4.  UserInfo Response Validation

   To validate the UserInfo Response, the Client MUST do the following:

   1.  If the Client has provided a "userinfo_encrypted_response_alg"
       parameter during Registration, decrypt the UserInfo Response
       using the key pair specified during Registration.

   2.  If the response was signed, the Client SHOULD validate the
       signature according to JWS [JWS].

   3.  Check that the OP that responded was the intended OP through a
       TLS server certificate check, per RFC 6125 [RFC6125].

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


4.5.  Access Token Validation

   To validate an Access Token issued from the Authorization Endpoint
   with an ID Token in response to a request containing a
   "response_type" of "id_token token" or "code id_token token", the
   Client SHOULD do the following:

   1.  Hash the octets of the ASCII representation of the "access_token"
       with the hash algorithm specified in JWS [JWA] for the "alg"
       parameter in the ID Token's JWS [JWS] header.

   2.  Take the left-most half of the hash and base64url encode it.

   3.  The value of "at_hash" in the ID Token MUST match the value
       produced in the previous step if "at_hash" is present in the ID
       Token.

4.6.  Code Validation

   To validate a "code" issued from the Authorization Endpoint with an
   ID Token in response to a request containing a "response_type" of
   "code id_token" or "code id_token token", the Client SHOULD do the
   following:

   1.  Hash the octets of the ASCII representation of the "code" with
       the hash algorithm specified in JWS [JWA] for the "alg" parameter
       in the ID Token's JWS [JWS] header.

   2.  Take the left-most half of the hash and base64url encode it.

   3.  The value of "c_hash" in the ID Token MUST match the value
       produced in the previous step if "c_hash" is present in the ID
       Token.

5.  Offline Access

   The "offline_access" scope value requests that an OAuth 2.0 Refresh
   Token be issued that can be used to obtain an Access Token that
   grants access to the End-User's UserInfo Endpoint even when the End-
   User is not present (not logged in).  When offline access is
   requested, a "prompt" parameter value of "consent" MUST be used
   unless other conditions for processing permitting offline access to
   the requested resources are in place.  The OP MUST always obtain
   consent to returning a Refresh Token that enables offline access to
   the requested resources.  A previously saved user consent is not
   always sufficient to grant offline access.

   Upon receipt of a scope parameter containing the "offline_access"
   value, the Authorization Server:

   o  MUST ensure that the prompt parameter contains "consent" unless
      other conditions for processing permitting offline access to the
      requested resources are in place; unless one or both of these
      conditions are fulfilled, then it MUST ignore the "offline_access"
      request,

   o  MUST ignore the "offline_access" request unless the Client is
      using a "response_type" value that would result in an
      Authorization Code being returned,

   o  MUST explicitly receive or have consent for all Clients when the
      registered "application_type" is "web",

   o  SHOULD explicitly receive or have consent for all Clients when the
      registered "application_type" is "native".

   The use of Refresh Tokens is not exclusive to the "offline_access"
   use case.  The Authorization Server MAY grant Refresh Tokens in other
   contexts that are beyond the scope of this specification.

6.  Initiating Login at Client from Third Party

   In some cases, the login flow can start at the Authorization Server
   or another party by contacting the Client via a stored link.  The
   target resource at the Client can be a deep link, rather than a
   default landing page.

   The Client MAY optionally register [OpenID.Registration] an
   "initiate_login_uri" that can be used by the Authorization Server or
   another party to initiate a login for an End-User at the Client.

   The Authorization Server or a third party sends a Login Initiation
   Request to the Client Initiation URI with the following parameters:

   login_hint  OPTIONAL.  Hint to the Authorization Server about the
      login identifier the End-User might use to log in.  If the client
      receives a value for this string-valued parameter, it MUST include
      it in the subsequent authorization request as the "login_hint"
      parameter value.

   iss  REQUIRED.  Issuer Identifier for the Issuer that the Client is
      to send the authentication request to.  Its value MUST be a URL
      using the "https" scheme.

   target_link_uri  OPTIONAL.  URI that the Client is requested to
      redirect to after authentication.  Clients MUST verify the value
      of the "target_link_uri" to prevent being used as an open
      redirector to external sites.

   Other parameters MAY be sent, if defined by extensions.  Any
   parameters used that are not understood MUST be ignored by the
   Client.

   Clients SHOULD employ frame busting and other techniques to prevent
   End-Users from being logged in by third party sites without their
   knowledge.

7.  Self-Issued OpenID Provider

   OpenID Connect supports Self-Issued OpenID Providers - personal OPs
   that issue self-signed ID Tokens.  Self-Issued OPs use the special
   Issuer Identifier "https://self-issued.me".

   The messages used to communicate with Self-Issued OPs are mostly the
   same as those used to communicate with other OPs.  Specifications for
   the few additional parameters used and for the values of some
   parameters in the Self-Issued case are defined in this section.

7.1.  Self-Issued OpenID Provider Discovery

   If the input identifier for the discovery process contains the domain
   self-issued.me, dynamic discovery is not performed.  Instead, then
   the following static configuration values are used:


     {
      "authorization_endpoint":
        "openid:",
      "issuer":
        "https://self-issued.me",
      "scopes_supported":
        ["openid", "profile", "email", "address", "phone"],
      "response_types_supported":
        ["id_token"],
      "subject_types_supported":
        ["pairwise"],
      "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported":
        ["RS256"],
      "request_object_signing_alg_values_supported":
        ["none", "RS256"]
     }

   Note: The OpenID Foundation may consider hosting a site
   https://self-issued.me/ that returns the above static configuration
   file so that the Client would not need any special treatment for
   discovery of the Self-Issued OP.

7.2.  Self-Issued OpenID Provider Registration

   When using a Self-Issued OP, the Client is deemed to have registered
   with the OP and obtained following Client Registration Response.







Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 78]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   client_id  "redirect_uri" value of the Client.

   client_secret_expires_at  0

   Note: The OpenID Foundation may consider hosting the (stateless)
   endpoint "https://self-issued.me/registration/1.0/" that returns the
   response above so that the Client would not need to perform any
   special processing for registration of a Self-Issued OP.

7.2.1.  Providing Additional Registration Information

   The "registration" request parameter is used by the Client to provide
   information about itself to a Self-Issued OP that would normally be
   provided to an OP during Dynamic Client Registration.  The value is a
   JSON object containing name/value pairs defined in Section 2.1 of the
   OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 [OpenID.Registration]
   specification.  None of this information is REQUIRED by Self-Issued
   OPs, so the use of this parameter is OPTIONAL.

   The "registration" parameter value is represented in an OAuth 2.0
   request as UTF-8 encoded JSON (which ends up being form-urlencoded
   when passed as an OAuth parameter).  When used in a Request Object
   value, per Section 2.10.1, the JSON is used as the value of the
   "registration" member.

   The Registration parameters that would typically be used in requests
   to Self-Issued OPs are "policy_uri", "tos_uri", and "logo_uri".  If
   the Client uses more than one redirection URI, the "redirect_uris"
   parameter would be used to register them.  Finally, if the Client is
   requesting encrypted responses, it would use the "jwks_uri",
   "id_token_encrypted_response_alg" and
   "id_token_encrypted_response_enc" parameters.

7.3.  Self-Issued OpenID Provider Request

   The Client sends the Authorization Request to the Authorization
   Endpoint with the following parameters:

   response_type  REQUIRED.  Constant string value "id_token".

   client_id  REQUIRED.  Client ID value for the Client, which in this
      case contains the "redirect_uri" value of the Client.  Since the
      Client's "redirect_uri" URI value is communicated as the Client
      ID, a "redirect_uri" parameter is NOT REQUIRED to also be included
      in the request.

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   scope  REQUIRED. "scope" parameter value, as specified in
      Section 2.5.

   id_token_hint  OPTIONAL.  Previously issued ID Token passed to the
      Authorization Server as a hint about the End-User's current or
      past authenticated session with the Client.  This SHOULD be
      present when "prompt=none" is used.  If the End-User identified by
      the ID Token is logged in or is logged in by the request, then the
      Authorization Server returns a positive response; otherwise, it
      SHOULD return a negative response.

      If the ID Token received by the RP is encrypted, the Client MUST
      decrypt the signed ID Token contained within the encrypted ID
      Token.  The Client MAY re-encrypt the signed ID token to the
      Authentication Server using a key that enables the server to
      decrypt the ID Token.  In this case, the "sub" (subject) of the
      signed ID Token MUST be sent as the "kid" (Key ID) of the JWE.
      Encrypting content to Self-Issued OPs is currently only supported
      when the OP's JWK key type is "RSA" and the encryption algorithm
      used is "RSA1_5".

   claims  OPTIONAL.  This parameter is used to request that specific
      Claims be returned.  The value is a JSON object, as specified in
      Section 2.7.

   registration  OPTIONAL.  This parameter is used by the Client to
      provide information about itself to a Self-Issued OP that would
      normally be provided to an OP during Dynamic Client Registration,
      as specified in Section 7.2.1.

   request  OPTIONAL.  Request Object value, as specified in
      Section 2.10.1.  The Request Object MAY be encrypted in a JWE by
      the Client.  In this case, the "sub" (subject) of a previously
      issued ID Token for this Client MUST be sent as the "kid" (Key ID)
      of the JWE.  Encrypting content to Self-Issued OPs is currently
      only supported when the OP's JWK key type is "RSA" and the
      encryption algorithm used is "RSA1_5".

   Other parameters MAY be sent.  Note that all Claims are returned in
   the ID Token.

   The entire URL MUST NOT exceed 2048 ASCII characters.

   The following is a non-normative example response (with line wraps
   within values for display purposes only):

     HTTP/1.1 302 Found
     Location: openid://?
       response_type=id_token
       &client_id=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb

         client.example.org%2Flogo.png%22%7D

7.4.  Self-Issued OpenID Provider Response

   The Self-Issued OpenID Provider response is the same as the normal
   implicit flow response with the following refinements.  Since it is
   an implicit flow response, the response parameters will be returned
   in the URL fragment component.

   1.  The "iss" (issuer) Claim Value is "https://self-issued.me".

   2.  A "sub_jwk" Claim is present, with its value being the public key
       value used to check the signature of the ID Token.

   3.  The "sub" (subject) Claim value is the base64url encoded SHA-256
       hash of the concatenation of the octets of the UTF-8
       representations of the base64url encoded key values in the
       "sub_jwk" Claim.  When the "kty" value is "RSA", the key values
       "n" and "e" are concatenated in that order.  When the "kty" value
       is "EC", the key values "crv", "x", and "y" are concatenated in
       that order.

   4.  No Access Token is returned for accessing a UserInfo Endpoint, so
       all Claims returned MUST be in the ID Token.

7.5.  Self-Issued ID Token Validation

   If any of the validation procedures defined in this specification
   fail, any operations requiring the information that failed to
   correctly validate MUST be aborted and the information that failed to
   validate MUST NOT be used.

   To validate the ID Token in the Authorization or Token Endpoint
   Response, the Client MUST do the following:






Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 81]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   1.  The Client MUST validate that the value of the "iss" (issuer)
       Claim is "https://self-isued.me".  If "iss" contains a different
       value, the ID Token is not Self-Issued, and instead it MUST be
       validated according to Section 4.3.

   2.  The Client MUST validate that the "aud" (audience) Claim contains
       the value of the "redirect_uri" that the Client sent in the
       authentication request as an audience.

   3.  The Client MUST validate the signature of the ID Token according
       to JWS [JWS] using the algorithm specified in the "alg" parameter
       of the JWT header [JWT], using the key in the "sub_jwk" Claim;
       the key is a bare key in JWK format (not an X.509 certificate
       value).

   4.  The "alg" value SHOULD be the default of "RS256".  It MAY also be
       "ES256".

   5.  The Client MUST validate that the "sub" (subject) Claim value is
       the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash of the concatenation of the
       octets of the UTF-8 representations of the base64url encoded key
       values in the "sub_jwk" Claim.  When the "kty" value is "RSA",
       the key values "n" and "e" are concatenated in that order.  When
       the "kty" value is "EC", the key values "crv", "x", and "y" are
       concatenated in that order.

   6.  The current time MUST be less than the value of the "exp" Claim
       (possibly allowing for some small leeway to account for clock
       skew).

   7.  The "iat" Claim can be used to reject tokens that were issued too
       far away from the current time, limiting the amount of time that
       nonces need to be stored to prevent attacks.  The acceptable
       range is Client specific.

   8.  If a nonce value was sent in the Authorization Request, a "nonce"
       Claim MUST be present and its value of the checked to verify that
       it is the same value as the one that was sent in the
       Authorization Request.  The Client SHOULD check the "nonce" value
       for replay attacks.  The precise method for detecting replay
       attacks is Client specific.

   1.  Query String Serialization

   2.  Form Serialization

   3.  JSON Serialization

   Not all methods can be used for all messages.

8.1.  Query String Serialization

   In order to serialize the parameters using the Query String
   Serialization, the Client constructs the string by adding the
   parameters and values to the query component of a URL using the
   "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format as defined by
   [W3C.REC-html401-19991224].  Query String Serialization is typically
   used in HTTP "GET" requests.  The same serialization method is also
   used when adding parameters to the fragment component of a URL.

   The following is a non-normative example of this serialization (with
   line wraps within values for display purposes only):

     GET /authorize?scope=openid&response_type=code
       &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
       &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com

8.2.  Form Serialization

   Parameters and their values are Form Serialized by adding the
   parameter names and values to the entity body of the HTTP request
   using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format as defined by
   [W3C.REC-html401-19991224].  Form Serialization is typically used in
   HTTP "POST" requests.

   The following is a non-normative example of this serialization (with
   line wraps within values for display purposes only):

     POST /authorize HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

     scope=openid&response_type=code
       &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
       &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


8.3.  JSON Serialization

   The parameters are serialized into a JSON structure by adding each
   parameter at the highest structure level.  Parameter names and string
   values are included as JSON strings.  Numerical values are included
   as JSON numbers.  Each parameter MAY have a JSON structure as its
   value.

   The following is a non-normative example of this serialization:

     {
      "access_token":"SlAV32hkKG",
      "expires_in":3600,
      "refresh_token":"8xLOxBtZp8"
     }

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


9.  String Operations

   Processing some OpenID Connect messages requires comparing values in
   the messages to known values.  For example, the Claim Names returned
   by the UserInfo Endpoint might be compared to specific Claim Names
   such as "sub".  Comparing Unicode strings, however, has significant
   security implications.

   Therefore, comparisons between JSON strings and other Unicode strings
   MUST be performed as specified below:

   1.  Remove any JSON applied escaping to produce an array of Unicode
       code points.

   2.  Unicode Normalization [USA15] MUST NOT be applied at any point to
       either the JSON string or to the string it is to be compared
       against.

   3.  Comparisons between the two strings MUST be performed as a
       Unicode code point to code point equality comparison.

   In several places, this specification uses space delimited lists of
   strings.  In all such cases, only the ASCII space character (0x20)
   MAY be used for this purpose.

10.  Implementation Considerations

   This specification defines features used by both Relying Parties and
   OpenID Providers.  Features that are mandatory to implement for
   Relying Parties are already described in the OpenID Connect Basic
   Client Profile 1.0 [OpenID.Basic] and OpenID Connect Implicit Client
   Profile 1.0 [OpenID.Implicit] specifications, and so are not
   discussed again here.

   It is expected that some OpenID Providers will require static, out-
   of-band configuration of RPs using them, whereas others will support
   dynamic usage by RPs without a pre-established relationship between
   them.  For that reason, the mandatory-to-implement features for OPs
   are listed below in two groups: the first for all OPs and the second
   for "Dynamic" OpenID Providers.

10.1.  Mandatory to Implement Features for All OpenID Providers

   All OpenID Providers MUST implement the following features defined in
   this specification.  This list augments the set of features that are
   already listed elsewhere as being "REQUIRED" or are described with a
   "MUST", and so is not, by itself, a comprehensive set of
   implementation requirements for OPs.

   Signing ID Tokens with RSA SHA-256  OPs MUST support signing ID
      Tokens with the RSA SHA-256 algorithm (an "alg" value of "RS256").

   Prompt Parameter  OPs MUST support the "prompt" parameter, as defined
      in Section 2.1.2.1, including the specified user interface
      behaviors such as "none" and "login".

   Display Parameter  OPs MUST support the "display" parameter, as
      defined in Section 2.1.2.1.  (Note that the minimum level of
      support required for this parameter is simply to have its use not
      result in an error.)

   Preferred Locales  OPs MUST support requests for preferred languages
      and scripts for the user interface and for Claims via the
      "ui_locales" and "claims_locales" request parameters, as defined
      in Section 2.1.2.1.  (Note that the minimum level of support
      required for these parameters is simply to have their use not
      result in errors.)

   Authentication Time  OPs MUST support returning the time at which the
      End-User authenticated via the "auth_time" Claim, as defined in
      Section 2.1.5.1.





Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 87]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   Maximum Authentication Age  OPs MUST support enforcing a maximum
      authentication age via the "max_age" parameter, as defined in
      Section 2.1.2.1.

   Authentication Context Class Reference  OPs MUST support requests for
      specific Authentication Context Class Reference values via the
      "acr_values" parameter, as defined in Section 2.1.2.1.  (Note that
      the minimum level of support required for this parameter is simply
      to have its use not result in an error.)

10.2.  Mandatory to Implement Features for Dynamic OpenID Providers

   In addition to the features listed above, OpenID Providers supporting
   dynamic establishment of relationships with RPs that they do not have
   a pre-configured relationship with MUST also implement the following
   features defined in this and related specifications.

   Discovery  These OPs MUST support Discovery, as defined in OpenID
      Connect Discovery 1.0 [OpenID.Discovery].

   Dynamic Registration  These OPs MUST support Dynamic Client
      Registration, as defined in OpenID Connect Dynamic Client
      Registration 1.0 [OpenID.Registration].

   UserInfo Endpoint  All dynamic OPs that issue Access Tokens MUST
      support the UserInfo Endpoint, as defined in Section 2.4.  (Self-
      Issued OPs do not issue Access Tokens.)

   Public Keys Published as Bare Keys  These OPs MUST publish their
      public keys as bare keys, rather than in X.509 format.

   Request URI  These OPs MUST support requests made using a Request
      Object value that is retrieved from a Request URI that is provided
      with the "request_uri" parameter, as defined in Section 2.1.2.1.

10.3.  Discovery and Registration

   Some OpenID Connect installations can use a pre-configured set of
   OpenID Providers and/or Relying Parties.  In those cases, it might
   not be necessary to support dynamic discovery of information about
   identities or services or dynamic registration of Clients.

   However, if installations choose to support unanticipated
   interactions between Relying Parties and OpenID Providers that do not
   have pre-configured relationships, they SHOULD accomplish this by
   implementing the facilities defined in the OpenID Connect Discovery
   1.0 [OpenID.Discovery] and OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration
   1.0 [OpenID.Registration] specifications.

11.  Security Considerations

   This specification references the security considerations defined in
   Section 10 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], and Section 5 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer
   Token Usage [RFC6750].  Furthermore, the OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and
   Security Considerations [RFC6819] specification provides an extensive
   list of threats and controls that apply to this specification as
   well, given that it is based upon OAuth 2.0.  ISO/IEC 29115
   [ISO29115] also provides threats and controls that implementers need
   to take into account.  Implementers are highly advised to read these
   references in detail and apply the countermeasures described therein.

   In addition, the following list of attack vectors and remedies are
   also considered.

11.1.  Request Disclosure

   If appropriate measures are not taken, a request might be disclosed
   to an attacker, posing security and privacy threats.

   In addition to what is stated in Section 5.1.1 of [RFC6819], this
   standard provides a way to provide the confidentiality of the request
   end to end through the use of "request" or "request_uri" parameters,
   where the content of the "request" is an encrypted JWT with the
   appropriate key and cipher.  This protects even against a compromised
   User-Agent in the case of indirect request.

11.2.  Server Masquerading

   A malicious Server might masquerade as the legitimate server using
   various means.  To detect such an attack, the Client needs to
   authenticate the server.

   In addition to what is stated in Section 5.1.2 of [RFC6819], this
   standard provides a way to authenticate the Server through either the
   use of Signed or Encrypted JWTs with an appropriate key and cipher.

11.3.  Token Manufacture/Modification

   An Attacker might generate a bogus token or modify the token content
   (such as the authentication or attribute statements) of an existing
   parseable token, causing the RP to grant inappropriate access to the
   Client.  For example, an Attacker might modify the parseable token to
   extend the validity period; a Client might modify the parseable token
   to have access to information that they should not be able to view.

   There are two ways to mitigate this attack:




Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 90]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   1.  The token can be digitally signed by the OP.  The Relying Party
       SHOULD validate the digital signature to verify that it was
       issued by a legitimate OP.

   2.  The token can be sent over a protected channel such as TLS.  See
       Section 11.16 for more information on using TLS.  In this
       specification, the token is always sent over a TLS protected
       channel.  Note however, that this measure is only a defense
       against third party attackers and is not applicable to the case
       where the Client is the attacker.

11.4.  Server Response Disclosure

   The server response might contain authentication and attribute
   statements that include sensitive Client information.  Disclosure of
   the response contents can make the Client vulnerable to other types
   of attacks.

   The server response disclosure can be mitigated in the following two
   ways:

   1.  Using the "code" response type.  The response is sent over a TLS
       protected channel, where the Client is authenticated by the
       "client_id" and "client_secret".

   2.  For other response types, the signed response can be encrypted
       with the Client's public key or a shared secret as an encrypted
       JWT with an appropriate key and cipher.

11.5.  Server Response Repudiation

   A response might be repudiated by the server if the proper mechanisms
   are not in place.  For example, if a Server does not digitally sign a
   response, the Server can claim that it was not generated through the
   services of the Server.

   To mitigate this threat, the response MAY be digitally signed by the
   Server using a key that supports non-repudiation.  The Client SHOULD
   validate the digital signature to verify that it was issued by a
   legitimate Server and its integrity is intact.

11.6.  Request Repudiation

   Since it is possible for a compromised or malicious Client to send a
   request to the wrong party, a Client that was authenticated using
   only a bearer token can repudiate any transaction.

   To mitigate this threat, the Server MAY require that the request be



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 91]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   digitally signed by the Client using a key that supports non-
   repudiation.  The Server SHOULD validate the digital signature to
   verify that it was issued by a legitimate Client and the integrity is
   intact.

11.7.  Access Token Redirect

   An Attacker uses the Access Token generated for one resource to
   obtain access to a second resource.

   To mitigate this threat, the Access Token SHOULD be audience and
   scope restricted.  One way of implementing it is to include the
   identifier of the resource for whom it was generated as audience.
   The resource verifies that incoming tokens include its identifier as
   the audience of the token.

11.8.  Token Reuse

   An Attacker attempts to use a one-time use token such as an
   Authorization Code that has already been used once with the intended
   Resource.  To mitigate this threat, the token SHOULD include a
   timestamp and a short validity lifetime.  The Relying Party then
   checks the timestamp and lifetime values to ensure that the token is
   currently valid.

   Alternatively, the server MAY record the state of the use of the
   token and check the status for each request.

11.9.   Eavesdropping or Leaking Authorization Codes (Secondary
       Authenticator Capture)

   In addition to the attack patterns described in Section 4.4.1.1 of
   [RFC6819], an Authorization Code can be captured in the User-Agent
   where the TLS session is terminated if the User-Agent is infected by
   malware.  However, capturing it is not useful as long as the profile
   uses either Client authentication or an encrypted response.

11.10.  Token Substitution

   Token Substitution is a class of attacks in which a malicious user
   swaps various tokens, including swapping an Authorization Code for a
   legitimate user with another token that the attacker has.  One means
   of accomplishing this is for the attacker to copy a token out one
   session and use it in an HTTP message for a different session, which
   is easy to do when the token is available to the browser; this is
   known as the "cut and paste" attack.

   The implicit flow of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] is not designed to mitigate



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 92]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   this risk.  In Section 10.16, it normatively requires that any use of
   the authorization process as a form of delegated End-User
   authentication to the Client MUST NOT use the implicit flow without
   employing additional security mechanisms that enable the Client to
   determine whether the Access Token was issued for its use.

   In OpenID Connect, this is mitigated through mechanisms provided
   through the ID Token.  The ID Token is a signed security token that
   provides Claims such as "iss" (issuer), "sub" (subject), "aud"
   (audience), "azp" (authorized party), "at_hash" (access token hash),
   and "c_hash" (code hash).  Using the ID Token, the Client is capable
   of detecting the Token Substitution Attack.

   The "c_hash" in the ID Token enables Clients to prevent "code"
   substitution.

   Also, a malicious user may attempt to impersonate a more privileged
   user by subverting the communication channel between the
   Authorization Endpoint and Client, or the Token Endpoint and Client,
   for example by swapping the "code" or reordering the messages, to
   convince the Token Endpoint that the attacker's authorization grant
   corresponds to a grant sent on behalf of a more privileged user.

   For HTTP bindings such as OpenID Connect Standard 1.0, the responses
   to Token Requests are bound to the corresponding requests by message
   order in HTTP, as both the response containing the token and requests
   are protected by TLS, which will detect and prevent packet
   reordering.

   When designing another binding of OpenID Connect Messages to a
   protocol incapable of strongly binding Token Endpoint requests to
   responses, additional mechanisms to address this issue MUST be
   utilized.  One such mechanism could be to include an ID Token with a
   "c_hash" Claim in the token request and response.

11.11.  Timing Attack

   A timing attack allows the attacker to obtain an unnecessary large
   amount of information through the elapsed time differences in the
   code paths taken by successful and unsuccessful decryption operations
   or successful and unsuccessful signature validation of a message.  It
   can be used to reduce the effective key length of the cipher used.

   Implementations SHOULD NOT terminate the validation process at the
   instant of the finding an error but SHOULD continue running until all
   the octets have been processed to avoid this attack.





Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 93]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


11.12.  Other Crypto Related Attacks

   There are various crypto related attacks possible depending on the
   method used for encryption and signature / integrity checking.
   Implementers need to consult the Security Considerations for the JWT
   [JWT] specification and specifications that it references to avoid
   the vulnerabilities identified in these specifications.

11.13.  Signing and Encryption Order

   Signatures over encrypted text are not considered valid in many
   jurisdictions.  Therefore, for integrity and non-repudiation, this
   specification requires signing the plain text JSON Claims.

11.14.  Issuer Identifier

   OpenID Connect supports multiple issuers per Host and Port
   combination.  The issuer returned by discovery MUST exactly match the
   value of "iss" in the ID Token.

   OpenID Connect treats the path component of any URI as part of the
   user identifier.  For instance, the subject "1234" with an issuer of
   "https://example.com" is not equivalent to the subject "1234" with an
   issuer of "https://example.com/sales".

   It is RECOMMENDED that only a single issuer per host be used.

11.15.  Implicit Grant Flow Threats

   In the implicit grant flow, the Access Token is returned in the
   fragment component of the Client's "redirect_uri" through HTTPS, thus
   it is protected between the OP and the User-Agent, and User-Agent and
   the RP.  The only the place it can be captured is the User-Agent
   where the TLS session is terminated, and is possible if the User-
   Agent is infested by malware.

11.16.  TLS Requirements

   Implementations MUST support TLS.  Which version(s) ought to be
   implemented will vary over time, and depend on the widespread
   deployment and known security vulnerabilities at the time of
   implementation.  At the time of this writing, TLS version 1.2
   [RFC5246] is the most recent version, but has very limited actual
   deployment, and might not be readily available in implementation
   toolkits.  TLS version 1.0 [RFC2246] is the most widely deployed
   version, and will give the broadest interoperability.

   To protect against information disclosure and tampering,



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 94]

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


   confidentiality protection MUST be applied using TLS with a
   ciphersuite that provides confidentiality and integrity protection.

   Whenever TLS is used, a TLS server certificate check MUST be
   performed, per RFC 6125 [RFC6125].

11.17.  Lifetimes of Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens

   Access Token grants are not revocable by the Authorization Server.
   Access Token grant lifetimes SHOULD be kept to single use or very
   short lifetimes.

   If access to the UserInfo Endpoint or other protected resources is
   required, a Refresh Token SHOULD be used.  The Client MAY then
   exchange the Refresh Token at the Token Endpoint for a fresh short-
   lived Access Token that can be used to access the resource.

   The Authorization Server SHOULD clearly identify long-term grants to
   the User during Authorization.  The Authorization Server SHOULD
   provide a mechanism for the End-User to revoke Refresh Tokens granted
   to a Client.

11.18.  Symmetric Key Entropy

   In Section 3.3 and Section 3.4, keys are derived from the
   "client_secret" value.  Thus, when used with symmetric signing or
   encryption operations, "client_secret" values MUST contain sufficient
   entropy to generate cryptographically strong keys.  Also,
   "client_secret" values MUST also contain at least the minimum of
   number of octets required for MAC keys for the particular algorithm
   used.  So for instance, for "HS256", the "client_secret" value MUST
   contain at least 8 octets (and almost certainly SHOULD contain more,
   since "client_secret" values are likely to use a restricted alphabet.

11.19.  Need for Signed Requests

   In some situations, Clients might need to use signed requests to
   ensure that the desired request parameters are delivered to the OP
   without having been tampered with.  For instance, the "max_age" and
   "acr_values" provide more assurance about the nature of the
   authentication performed when delivered in signed requests.

11.20.  Need for Encrypted Requests

   In some situations, knowing the contents of an OpenID Connect request
   can, in and of itself, reveal sensitive information about the End-
   User.  For instance, knowing that the Client is requesting a
   particular Claim or that it is requesting that a particular



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 95]

   authentication method be used can reveal sensitive information about
   the End-User.  OpenID Connect enables requests to be encrypted to the
   OpenID Provider to prevent such potentially sensitive information
   from being revealed.

                         OpenID Connect Core 1.0          September 2013


12.  Privacy Considerations

12.1.  Personally Identifiable Information

   The UserInfo Response typically contains Personally Identifiable
   Information (PII).  As such, End-User consent for the release of the
   information for the specified purpose SHOULD be obtained at or prior
   to the authorization time in accordance with relevant regulations.
   The purpose of use is typically registered in association with the
   "redirect_uris".

   Only necessary UserInfo data should be stored at the Client and the
   Client SHOULD associate the received data with the purpose of use
   statement.

12.2.  Data Access Monitoring

   The Resource Server SHOULD make the UserInfo access log available to
   the End-User so that the End-User can monitor who accessed his data.

12.3.  Correlation

   To protect the End-User from a possible correlation among Clients,
   the use of a Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID) as the "sub"
   (subject) SHOULD be considered.

12.4.  Offline Access

   Offline access enables access to Claims when the user is not present,
   posing greater privacy risk than the Claims transfer when the user is
   present.  Therefore, it is prudent to obtain explicit consent for
   offline access to resources.  This specification mandates the use of
   the "prompt" parameter to obtain consent unless it is a priori known
   that the request complies with the conditions for processing in each
   jurisdiction.

   When an Access Token is returned in the front channel, there is a
   greater risk of it being exposed to an attacker, who could later use
   it to access the UserInfo endpoint.  If the Access Token does not
   enable offline access and the server can differentiate whether the
   Client request has been made offline or online, the risk will be
   substantially reduced.  Therefore, this specification mandates
   ignoring the offline access request when the Access Token is
   transmitted in the front channel.  Note that differentiating between
   online and offline access from the server can be difficult especially
   for native clients.  The server may well have to rely on heuristics.
   Also, the risk of exposure for the Access Token delivered in the
   front channel for the response types of "code token" and "token" is

   the same.  Thus, the implementations should be prepared to detect the
   channel from which the Access Token was issued and deny offline
   access if the token was issued in the front channel.

   Note that although these provisions require an explicit consent
   dialogue through the "prompt" parameter, the mere fact that the user
   pressed an "accept" button etc., might not constitute a valid
   consent.  Developers should be aware that for the act of consent to
   be valid, typically, the impact of the terms have to be understood by
   the End-User, the consent must be freely given and not forced (i.e.,
   other options have to be available), and the terms must fair and
   equitable.  In general, it is advisable for the service to follow the
   required privacy principles in each jurisdiction and rely on other
   conditions of processing than simply explicit consent, as online
   self-service "explicit consent" often does not form a valid consent
   in some jurisdictions.

   The technology described in this specification was made available
   from contributions from various sources, including members of the
   OpenID Foundation and others.  Although the OpenID Foundation has
   taken steps to help ensure that the technology is available for
   distribution, it takes no position regarding the validity or scope of
   any intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in
   this specification or the extent to which any license under such
   rights might or might not be available; neither does it represent
   that it has made any independent effort to identify any such rights.
   The OpenID Foundation and the contributors to this specification make

   or otherwise), including implied warranties of merchantability, non-
   infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or title, related to
   this specification, and the entire risk as to implementing this
   specification is assumed by the implementer.  The OpenID Intellectual
   Property Rights policy requires contributors to offer a patent
   promise not to assert certain patent claims against other
   contributors and against implementers.  The OpenID Foundation invites
   any interested party to bring to its attention any copyrights,
   patents, patent applications, or other proprietary rights that may
   cover technology that may be required to practice this specification.
