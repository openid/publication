       Initiating User Registration via OpenID Connect - draft 05
                    openid-connect-prompt-create-1_0

Abstract

   An extension to the OpenID Connect Authentication Framework defining
   a new value for the prompt parameter that instructs the OpenID
   Provider to start the user flow with user registration and after the
   user account has been created return an authorization code to the
   client to complete the authentication flow.

1.  Introduction

   Several years of deployment and implementation experience with OpenID
   Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core] has uncovered a need, in some
   circumstances, for the client to explicitly signal to the OpenID
   Provider that the user desires to create a new account rather than
   authenticate an existing identity.

   This specification allows the client to indicate to the OpenID
   Provider that the user desires to create an account improving the
   user experience by reducing the friction for the user of finding the
   sign-up link on the default login page.

   This specification defines a new value for the prompt parameter.

2.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   In the .txt version of this specification, values are quoted to
   indicate that they are to be taken literally.  When using these
   values in protocol messages, the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of
   the value.  In the HTML version of this specification, values to be
   taken literally are indicated by the use of this fixed-width font.

3.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "authorization endpoint",
   "authorization request", "authorization response", and "client"
   defined by The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC6749].

4.  Prompt Parameter

   In requests to the OpenID Provider, a client MAY indicate that the
   desired user experience is for the user to immediately see the user
   account creation UI instead of the login behavior.

   prompt
      A value of create indicates to the OpenID Provider that the client
      desires that the user be shown the account creation UX rather than
      the login flow.  Care must be taken if combining this value with
      other prompt values.  Mutually exclusive conditions can arise so
      it is RECOMMENDED that create not be combined with any other
      values.

4.1.  Authorization Request

   When the prompt parameter is used in an authorization request to the
   authorization endpoint with the value of create, it indicates that
   the user has chosen to be shown the account creation experience
   rather than the login experience.  Whether the AS creates a brand new
   identity or helps the user authenticate an identity they already have
   is out of scope for this specification.  The behavior is the same for
   all response types.

   For authorization requests sent as a JWT, such as when using
   Section 6 of OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core], the prompt claim
   value MUST be a space delimited set of prompt values in keeping with
   Section 3.1.2.1 of OpenID Connect Core 1.0.

   If the OpenID Provider receives a prompt value that it does not
   support (not declared in the prompt_values_supported metadata field)
   the OP SHOULD respond with an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code and
   an error value of invalid_request.  It is RECOMMENDED that the OP
   return an error_description value identifying the invalid parameter
   value.

   In Figure 1 is an example of an authorization request using the code
   response type where the client tells the OpenID Provider that it
   wants the user to start from the account creation user experience
   (extra line breaks and indentation are for display purposes only).

     GET /as/authorization.oauth2?response_type=code
        &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
        &state=tNwzQ87pC6llebpmac_IDeeq-mCR2wLDYljHUZUAWuI
        &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Eorg%2Fcb
        &scope=openid%20profile
        &prompt=create HTTP/1.1
     Host: authorization-server.example.com

4.2.  Discovery Metadata

   This specification extends the OpenID Connect Discovery Metadata
   Section 3 [OpenID.Discovery] and defines the following:

   prompt_values_supported
      OPTIONAL.  JSON array containing the list of prompt values that
      this OP supports.

   This metadata element is OPTIONAL in the context of the OpenID
   Provider not supporting the create value.  If omitted, the Relying
   Party should assume that this specification is not supported.  The
   OpenID Provider MAY provide this metadata element even if it doesn't
   support the create value.

   Specific to this specification, a value of create in the array
   indicates to the Relying party that this OpenID Provider supports
   this specification.  If an OpenID Provider supports this
   specification it MUST define this metadata element in the openid-
   configuration file.  Additionally, if this metadata element is
   defined by the OpenID Provider, the OP must also specify all other
   prompt values which it supports.
