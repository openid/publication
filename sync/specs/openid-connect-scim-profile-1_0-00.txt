                OpenID Connect Profile for SCIM Services

Abstract

   SCIM (RFC7644) is an IETF protocol that enables HTTP clients to
   retrieve and manage cross-domain identities.  OpenID Connect 1.0 is a
   simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol which offers
   access to profile information through a UserInfo endpoint.  This
   specification defines how OpenID Connect relying parties may discover
   availability of and register for, and access, SCIM services as part
   of an OpenID Provider (OP) services.

1.  Introduction

   SCIM [RFC7644] is an IETF protocol that enables HTTP clients to
   retrieve and manage cross-domain identities.  OpenID Connect 1.0 is a
   simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] protocol
   which offers access to profile information through a UserInfo
   endpoint (see Section 5.3 [OpenID.Core]).  This specification defines
   how OpenID Connect relying parties may discover availability of and
   register for, and access, SCIM services as part of an OpenID Provider
   services.

   This specification defines the following metadata:

   o  Discovery metadata indicating the avilability of a SCIM protocol
      base endpoint.

   o  Dynamic registration metadata that is used to indicate a clients
      intent to use the SCIM protocol and its associated endpoint.

   o  An additional ID Token claim which specifies the SCIM resource
      endpoint and identifier associated with the authenticate subject.

   In addition to the above metadata attributes and claims, the
   specification will also show how a client MAY access the SCIM
   endpoint.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   In the .txt version of this document, values are quoted to indicate
   that they are to be taken literally.  When using these values in
   protocol messages, the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.
   In the HTML version of this document, values to be taken literally
   are indicated by the use of "this fixed-width font".

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Authorization
   Code", "Authorization Endpoint", "Authorization Grant",
   "Authorization Server", "Client", "Client Authentication", "Client
   Identifier", "Client Secret", "Grant Type", "Protected Resource",
   "Redirection URI", "Refresh Token", "Resource Owner", "Resource
   Server", "Response Type", and "Token Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749], the terms "JSON Web Token (JWT)" and "Nested JWT" defined

   by JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519], SCIM Protocol [RFC7644], OpenID
   Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core].  OpenID Discovery 1.0
   [OpenID.Discovery], and the terms defined by OpenID Connect Dynamic
   Client Registration 1.0 [OpenID.Registration].

   This specification uses the OpenID term "relying party" to refer to
   what is defined as a "client" in SCIM protocol (see Section 1.2
   [RFC7643]).

2.  Metadata and Claim Defintions

2.1.  Discovery Metadata

   This specification extends the OpenID Connect Discovery metadata
   Section 3 [OpenID.Discovery] and defines the following:

   scim_endpoint
      RECOMMENDED.  The base URI of the OP's designated SCIM service
      provider.  The base URI is as defined in Section 1.3 [RFC7644].
      This URI when appended with a path of "/Me" points to the subject
      authenticated by the OP.  Further, SCIM clients MAY discover SCIM
      configuration metadata by using this URI to query endpoints such
      as "/ServiceProviderConfig" (see Section 3.2 [RFC7644]).

2.2.  Dynamic Registration Metadata

   This specification extends the OpenID Connect Dynamic Registration
   draft (see Section 2 [OpenID.Registration]), and defines the
   following metadata:

   scim_profile
      RECOMMENDED.  Boolean value.  When the value is "true", it
      indicates that the client will use SCIM Protocol [RFC7644] to
      accessuser information.

2.3.  ID Token Claims

   This specification extends the claims in OpenID Connect Core Section
   5 [OpenID.Core] and defines the following:

   scim_id
      An identifier whose value corresponds to the "id" attribute as
      defined in Section 3.1 [RFC7643] that is associated with the
      authenticated subject ("sub").

   scim_location
      An URI whose value corresponds to the "meta.location" attribute as
      defined in Section 3.1 [RFC7643] and that is associated with the
      authenticated subject ("sub").  If this value differs from the
      discovered "scim_endpoint", the client MUST use the ID Token claim
      "scim_location" value.

3.  Using SCIM

   When using SCIM, the relying party MAY use all the protocol features
   of SCIM and act as a SCIM client.  A relying party MAY query SCIM
   configuration endpoints such as:

      _/ServiceProviderConfig_

      _/ResourceTypes_

      _/Schemas_

   The OpenID Connect profile for SCIM provides two ways for a relying
   party to construct a SCIM URI for the authenticated subject:

   o  The relying party MAY use the previously discovered
      "scim_endpoint" plus the path "/Me" as a URI alias (see Section
      3.11 of [RFC7644]).  Or,

   o  The relying party MAY use the URI returned in the "scim_resource"
      ID_Token claim provided.

   When accessing the SCIM endpoint, the relying party SHOULD use the
   access token issued in the response from the OP as its authorization
   to access the SCIM endpoint as per section 2 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer
   Token Usage [RFC6750].

   OpenID Connect relying parties MAY use "scope" values to request
   authorization as per Section 5.4 [OpenID.Core].  The values used in
   OpenID Connect SHALL be ignored for the purpose of authorizing access
   to SCIM.  These include:

   o  openid

   o  profile

   o  email

   o  address

   o  phone

   These scopes SHALL continue to be used as defined by OpenID Connect
   Core.  For example, as a list of claims to be included in the
   ID_Token.

   OpenID Connect Providers offering SCIM profile services MAY support
   SCIM specific scopes not defined in this specification.  OpenID

                       OpenID Connect SCIM Profile             June 2016


   Connect Providers MAY also use registration data to determine the
   appropriate scope of authorization for the purpose of access to the
   SCIM endpoint.

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification references the security considerations defined in
   Section 10 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], and Section 5 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer
   Token Usage [RFC6750].  Furthermore, the OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and
   Security Considerations [RFC6819] specification provides an extensive
   list of threats and controls that apply to this specification as
   well, given that it is based upon OAuth 2.0.  ISO/IEC 29115
   [ISO29115] also provides threats and controls that implementers need
   to take into account.  Implementers are highly advised to read these
   references in detail and apply the countermeasures described therein.

5.  Privacy Considerations

5.1.  Personally Identifiable Information

   The SCIM service providers typically contain Personally Identifiable
   Information (PII).  As such, End-User consent for the release of the
   information for the specified purpose should be obtained at or prior
   to the authorization time in accordance with relevant regulations.
   The purpose of use is typically registered in association with the
   "redirect_uris".

   Only necessary UserInfo data should be stored at the Client and the
   Client SHOULD associate the received data with the purpose of use
   statement.

5.2.  Data Access Monitoring

   The SCIM Resource Server SHOULD make End-Users' resource access logs
   available to them so that they can monitor who accessed their data.

5.3.  Correlation

   To protect the End-User from a possible correlation among Clients,
   the use of a Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID) as the "sub"
   (subject) SHOULD be considered.

5.4.  Offline Access

   Offline access enables access to Claims when the user is not present,
   posing greater privacy risk than the Claims transfer when the user is
   present.  Therefore, it is prudent to obtain explicit consent for
   offline access to resources.  This specification mandates the use of
   the "prompt" parameter to obtain consent unless it is already known
   that the request complies with the conditions for processing the
   request in each jurisdiction.

   When an Access Token is returned via the User Agent using the
   Implicit Flow or Hybrid Flow, there is a greater risk of it being
   exposed to an attacker, who could later use it to access the UserInfo
   endpoint.  If the Access Token does not enable offline access and the
   server can differentiate whether the Client request has been made
   offline or online, the risk will be substantially reduced.
   Therefore, this specification mandates ignoring the offline access
   request when the Access Token is transmitted through the User Agent.
   Note that differentiating between online and offline access from the
   server can be difficult especially for native clients.  The server
   may well have to rely on heuristics.  Also, the risk of exposure for
   the Access Token delivered through the User Agent for the Response



Hunt & Mortimore                                                [Page 9]

                       OpenID Connect SCIM Profile             June 2016


   Types of "code token" and "token" is the same.  Thus, the
   implementations should be prepared to detect whether the Access Token
   was issued through the User Agent or directly from the Token Endpoint
   and deny offline access if the token was issued through the User
   Agent.

   Note that although these provisions require an explicit consent
   dialogue through the "prompt" parameter, the mere fact that the user
   pressed an "accept" button etc., might not constitute a valid
   consent.  Developers should be aware that for the act of consent to
   be valid, typically, the impact of the terms have to be understood by
   the End-User, the consent must be freely given and not forced (i.e.,
   other options have to be available), and the terms must fair and
   equitable.  In general, it is advisable for the service to follow the
   required privacy principles in each jurisdiction and rely on other
   conditions for processing the request than simply explicit consent,
   as online self-service "explicit consent" often does not form a valid
   consent in some jurisdictions.
