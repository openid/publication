    <abstract>
      <t>OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
      protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based
      on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to
      obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and 
      REST-like manner.</t>

      <t>
	This OpenID Connect Basic Client Implementer's Guide 1.0 contains a subset of the
	OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification
	that is designed to be easy to read and implement for basic
	Web-based Relying Parties using the
	OAuth Authorization Code Flow.
	This specification intentionally duplicates content from the Core
	specification to provide a self-contained implementer's guide for basic
	Web-based Relying Parties using the
	OAuth Authorization Code Flow.
      </t>
      <t>
	OpenID Providers and non-Web-based applications
	should instead consult the Core specification.

      <t>
	This OpenID Connect Basic Client Implementer's Guide 1.0 contains a subset of the
	<xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</xref> specification
	that is designed to be easy to read and implement for basic
	Web-based Relying Parties using the
	OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"/> Authorization Code Flow.
	This specification intentionally duplicates content from the Core
	specification to provide a self-contained implementer's guide for basic
	Web-based Relying Parties using the
	OAuth Authorization Code Flow.
	Should there be any conflicts between the contents of this implementer's guide
	and the OpenID Connect Core specification, the latter takes precedence.
      </t>
      <t>
	See the
	<xref target="OpenID.Implicit">OpenID Connect Implicit Client Implementer's Guide 1.0</xref>
	for a related guide for basic
	Web-based Relying Parties using the
	OAuth Implicit Flow.
	OpenID Providers and non-Web-based applications
	should instead consult the Core specification.
	This guide omits implementation and security
	considerations for OpenID Providers and non-Web-based applications.
      </t>

      <t>
	As background,
	the <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework</xref>
	and <xref target="RFC6750">OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage</xref>
	specifications provide a general framework for third-party applications
	to obtain and use limited access to HTTP resources.  They define
	mechanisms to obtain and use Access Tokens to access resources but
	do not define standard methods to provide identity information.
	Notably, without profiling OAuth 2.0, it is incapable of
	providing information about the authentication of an End-User.
	Readers are expected to be familiar with these specifications.
      </t>
      <t>
	OpenID Connect implements authentication as an extension to the
	OAuth 2.0 authorization process.
	Use of this extension is requested by Clients by including
	the <spanx style="verb">openid</spanx> scope value
	in the Authorization Request.
	An Authorization Request using these extensions
	is called an Authentication Request.
      </t>
      <t>
	Information about the authentication performed is returned
	in a <xref target="JWT">JSON Web Token (JWT)</xref>
	called an ID Token (see <xref target="IDToken"/>).
	OAuth 2.0 Authentication Servers implementing OpenID Connect
	are also referred to as OpenID Providers (OPs).
	OAuth 2.0 Clients using OpenID Connect
	are also referred to as Relying Parties (RPs).
      </t>
      <t>
	This specification assumes that the Relying Party has already obtained
	configuration information about the OpenID Provider, including its
	Authorization Endpoint and Token Endpoint locations.
	This information is normally obtained via Discovery,
	as described in <xref target="OpenID.Discovery">OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0</xref>,
	or may be obtained via other mechanisms.
      </t>
      <t>
	Likewise, this specification assumes that the Relying Party has already obtained
	sufficient credentials and provided information needed to use the OpenID Provider.
	This is normally done via Dynamic Registration,
	as described in
	<xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0</xref>,
	or may be obtained via other mechanisms.
      </t>

	Authentication Requests can follow one of three paths:
	the Authorization Code Flow,
	the Implicit Flow, or
	the Hybrid Flow.
	The Authorization Code Flow is
	intended for Clients that can securely maintain a Client Secret between
	themselves and the Authorization Server, whereas the Implicit Flow is
	intended for Clients that cannot.
	However, the Authorization Code flow is sometimes also used by Native applications
	and other Clients in order to be able to obtain a Refresh Token,
	even when they cannot ensure the secrecy of the Client Secret value.
	The Hybrid Flow combines aspects of the Authorization Code Flow
	and the Implicit Flow.
	It enables Clients to obtain an ID Token and optionally an Access Token with only
	one round trip to the Authorization Server, possibly minimizing latency,
	while still enabling Clients to later get tokens from the Token Endpoint
	-- especially a Refresh Token.
      </t>

      <t>
	This specification only provides information that is sufficient for
	basic Clients using the Code Flow.
      </t>

      <section anchor="CodeFlow" title="Code Flow">

            <t>Authorization Server sends the End-User back to the Client with
	    <spanx style="verb">code</spanx>.</t>

            <t>Client sends the <spanx style="verb">code</spanx> to the
	    Token Endpoint to receive an Access Token and ID Token in the response.</t>

	    <t>Client validates the tokens and retrieves the End-User's

	  <t>The Client MUST validate the ID Token in the Token Response.  To do this,
	  the Client can split the ID Token at the

		If the ID Token contains multiple audiences, the Client SHOULD verify

	      <t>The <spanx style="verb">iat</spanx> Claim can be used to reject tokens that

	<section anchor="ClaimsLanguagesAndScripts" title="Claims Languages and Scripts">
	  <t>
	    Human-readable Claim Values and Claim Values that reference human-readable values
	    MAY be represented in multiple languages and scripts.
	    To specify the languages and scripts, <xref
	    target="RFC5646">BCP47</xref> language tags are added to member names,
	    delimited by a <spanx style="verb">#</spanx> character.  For example,
	    <spanx style="verb">family_name#ja-Kana-JP</spanx> expresses the
	    Family Name in Katakana in Japanese, which is commonly used to index
	    and represent the phonetics of the Kanji representation of the same
	    represented as <spanx style="verb">family_name#ja-Hani-JP</spanx>.
	    As another example, both <spanx style="verb">website</spanx> and
	    <spanx style="verb">website#de</spanx> Claim Values might be returned,
	    referencing a Web site in an unspecified language and a Web site
	    in German.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Since Claim Names are case sensitive, it is strongly RECOMMENDED
	    that language tag values used in Claim Names be spelled using the
	    character case with which they are registered in the
	    <xref target="IANA.Language">IANA Language Subtag Registry</xref>.
	    In particular, normally language names are spelled with lowercase characters,
	    region names are spelled with uppercase characters, and
	    scripts are spelled with mixed case characters.
	    However, since BCP47 language tag values are case insensitive,
	    implementations SHOULD interpret the language tag values supplied
	    in a case insensitive manner.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Per the recommendations in BCP47, language tag values for Claims
	    SHOULD only be as specific as necessary.
	    For instance, using <spanx style="verb">fr</spanx> might be sufficient
	    in many contexts, rather than <spanx style="verb">fr-CA</spanx> or
	    <spanx style="verb">fr-FR</spanx>.
	    Where possible, OPs SHOULD try to match requested Claim locales with
	    Claims it has.  For instance, if the Client asks for a Claim with
	    a <spanx style="verb">de</spanx> (German) language tag and the OP
	    has a value tagged with <spanx style="verb">de-CH</spanx> (Swiss German)
	    and no generic German value, it would be appropriate for the OP
	    to return the Swiss German value to the Client.
	    (This intentionally moves as much of the complexity of language tag
	    matching to the OP as possible, to simplify Clients.)
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    A <spanx style="verb">claims_locales</spanx> request can be used to
	    specify the preferred languages and scripts to use for the returned Claims.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    When the OP determines, either through the
	    <spanx style="verb">claims_locales</spanx> parameter,
	    or by other means, that the End-User and Client are
	    requesting Claims in only one set of languages and scripts,
	    it is RECOMMENDED that OPs return Claims without language tags
	    when they employ this language and script.
	    It is also RECOMMENDED that Clients be written in a manner
	    that they can handle and utilize Claims using language tags.
	  </t>

	<section anchor="ClaimStability" title="Claim Stability and Uniqueness">

	  <t>
	    The <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> (subject) and
	    <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> (issuer) Claims, used together,
	    are the only Claims that an RP
	    can rely upon as a stable identifier for the End-User,
	    since the <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx>
	    Claim MUST be locally unique and never reassigned within the Issuer
	    for a particular End-User, as described in <xref target="IDToken"></xref>.
	    Therefore, the only guaranteed unique identifier for a given End-User is the
	    combination of the <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> Claim
	    and the <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> Claim.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    All other Claims carry no such guarantees across different issuers in terms of
	    stability over time or uniqueness across users, and Issuers are permitted to
	    apply local restrictions and policies. For instance, an Issuer MAY re-use an
	    <spanx style="verb">email</spanx> Claim Value across different
	    End-Users at different points in time, and the claimed 
	    <spanx style="verb">email</spanx> address for a given End-User MAY change 
	    over time.
	    Therefore, other Claims such as <spanx style="verb">email</spanx>,
	    <spanx style="verb">phone_number</spanx>, and
	    <spanx style="verb">preferred_username</spanx>
	    and MUST NOT be used as unique identifiers for the End-User.

      </section>

      <section anchor="OfflineAccessPrivacy" title="Offline Access">

	<t>
	  Offline access enables access to Claims when the user is not present,
	  posing greater privacy risk than the Claims transfer when the user is present.
	  Therefore, it is prudent to obtain explicit consent for
	  offline access to resources.
	  This specification mandates the use of the <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx>
	  parameter to obtain consent unless it is already known that the
	  request complies with the conditions for processing the request in each jurisdiction.
	</t>
	<t>
	  When an Access Token is returned in the front channel, there is
	  a greater risk of it being exposed to an attacker, who could
	  later use it to access the UserInfo endpoint.
	  If the Access Token does not enable offline access and the server
	  can differentiate whether the Client request has been made
	  offline or online, the risk will be substantially reduced.
	  Therefore, this specification mandates ignoring
	  the offline access request when the Access Token is
	  transmitted in the front channel.
	  Note that differentiating between online and offline access
	  from the server can be difficult especially for native clients.
	  The server may well have to rely on heuristics.
	  Also, the risk of exposure for the Access Token delivered
	  in the front channel for the Response Types of
	  <spanx style="verb">code&nbsp;token</spanx> and
	  <spanx style="verb">token</spanx> is the same.
	  Thus, the implementations should be prepared to detect the
	  channel from which the Access Token was issued and deny offline access
	  if the token was issued in the front channel.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Note that although these provisions require an explicit
	  consent dialogue through the <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx> parameter,
	  the mere fact that the user pressed an "accept" button etc.,
	  might not constitute a valid consent.
	  Developers should be aware that for the act of consent to
	  be valid, typically, the impact of the terms have to be
	  understood by the End-User, the consent must be freely given
	  and not forced (i.e., other options have to be available),
	  and the terms must fair and equitable.
	  In general, it is advisable for the service to follow the
	  required privacy principles in each jurisdiction and rely on
	  other conditions for processing the request than simply explicit consent,
	  as online self-service "explicit consent" often does not
	  form a valid consent in some jurisdictions.
