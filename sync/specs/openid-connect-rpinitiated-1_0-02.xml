	</t>
      </section>

    <section anchor="RPLogout" title="RP-Initiated Logout">
      <t>
	An RP requests that the OP log out the End-User
	by redirecting the End-User's User Agent to the OP's Logout Endpoint.
	This URL is normally obtained via the
	<spanx style="verb">end_session_endpoint</spanx> element of the OP's
	Discovery response or may be learned via other mechanisms.
      </t>
      <t>
	This specification defines the following parameters
	that are used in the logout request at the Logout Endpoint:
      </t>
      <t>
	<list style="hanging">

	  <t hangText="id_token_hint">
	    <vspace/>
	    RECOMMENDED.
	    ID Token previously issued by the OP to the RP passed to the Logout Endpoint
	    as a hint about the End-User's current authenticated
	    session with the Client.
	    This is used as an indication of the identity of the
	    End-User that the RP is requesting be logged out by the OP.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="logout_hint">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    Hint to the Authorization Server about the End-User that is logging out.
	    The value and meaning of this parameter is left up to the OP's discretion.
	    For instance, the value might contain an email address, phone number, username,
	    or session identifier pertaining to the RP's session with the OP for the End-User.
	    (This parameter is intended to be analogous to the <spanx style="verb">login_hint</spanx>
	    parameter defined in Section 3.1.2.1 of <xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</xref>
	    that is used in Authentication Requests;
	    whereas, <spanx style="verb">logout_hint</spanx> is used in RP-Initiated Logout Requests.)
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="client_id">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    OAuth 2.0 Client Identifier valid at the Authorization Server. When both
	    <spanx style="verb">client_id</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">id_token_hint</spanx>
	    are present,
	    the OP MUST verify that the Client Identifier matches the one used when issuing the
	    ID Token. The most common use case for this parameter is to specify the Client Identifier
	    when <spanx style="verb">post_logout_redirect_uri</spanx> is used but
	    <spanx style="verb">id_token_hint</spanx> is not. Another use is for
	    symmetrically encrypted ID Tokens used as <spanx style="verb">id_token_hint</spanx> values
	    that require the Client Identifier
	    to be specified by other means, so that the ID Tokens can be decrypted by the OP.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="post_logout_redirect_uri">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    URI to which the RP is requesting that
	    the End-User's User Agent be redirected
	    after a logout has been performed.
	    This URI SHOULD use the <spanx style="verb">https</spanx> scheme
	    and MAY contain port, path, and query parameter components;
	    however, it MAY use the <spanx style="verb">http</spanx> scheme,
	    provided that the Client Type is <spanx style="verb">confidential</spanx>,
	    as defined in Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0</xref>, and
	    provided the OP allows the use of <spanx style="verb">http</spanx> RP URIs.
	    The URI MAY use an alternate scheme,
	    such as one that is intended to identify a callback into a native application.
	    The value MUST have been previously registered with the OP,
	    either using the <spanx style="verb">post_logout_redirect_uris</spanx>
	    Registration parameter or via another mechanism.
	    An <spanx style="verb">id_token_hint</spanx> is also RECOMMENDED when this parameter is included.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="state">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    Opaque value used by the RP to maintain state between
	    the logout request and the callback to the endpoint specified by
	    the <spanx style="verb">post_logout_redirect_uri</spanx> parameter.
	    If included in the logout request, the OP passes this value back to the RP
	    using the <spanx style="verb">state</spanx> parameter
	    when redirecting the User Agent back to the RP.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="ui_locales">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    End-User's preferred languages and scripts for the user interface,
	    represented as a space-separated list of
	    <xref target="RFC5646">BCP47</xref> language tag values,
	    ordered by preference.
	    For instance, the value "fr-CA fr en" represents a preference
	    for French as spoken in Canada,
	    then French (without a region designation),
	    followed by English (without a region designation).
	    An error SHOULD NOT result if some or all of the requested locales
	    are not supported by the OpenID Provider.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>

      <t>
	OpenID Providers MUST support the use of the HTTP <spanx style="verb">GET</spanx> and
	<spanx style="verb">POST</spanx> methods defined in <xref target="RFC7231">RFC 7231</xref> at the
	Logout Endpoint.
	RPs MAY use the HTTP <spanx style="verb">GET</spanx> or
	<spanx style="verb">POST</spanx> methods to send the
	logout request to the OP. If using the HTTP
	<spanx style="verb">GET</spanx> method, the request parameters are serialized using
	URI Query String Serialization.
	If using the HTTP <spanx style="verb">POST</spanx>
	method, the request parameters are serialized using
	Form Serialization.
      </t>

      <t>
	When an <spanx style="verb">id_token_hint</spanx> parameter is present,
	the OP MUST validate that it was the issuer of the ID Token.
	The OP SHOULD accept ID Tokens when the RP identified by the ID Token's
	<spanx style="verb">aud</spanx> claim and/or <spanx style="verb">sid</spanx> claim
	has a current session or had a recent session at the OP,
	even when the <spanx style="verb">exp</spanx> time has passed.
	If the ID Token's <spanx style="verb">sid</spanx> claim does not correspond
	to the RP's current session or a recent session at the OP,
	the OP SHOULD treat the logout request as suspect,
	and MAY decline to act upon it.
      </t>
      <t>
	At the Logout Endpoint, the OP SHOULD ask the End-User whether
	to log out of the OP as well.
	Furthermore, the OP MUST ask the End-User this question
	if an <spanx style="verb">id_token_hint</spanx> was not provided
	or if the supplied ID Token does not belong to the current OP session with the RP
	and/or currently logged in End-User.
	If the End-User says "yes", then the OP MUST log out the End-User.
      </t>
      <t>
	As part of the OP logging out the End-User,
	the OP uses the logout mechanism(s) registered by the RPs
	to notify any RPs logged in as that End-User
	that they are to likewise log out the End-User.
	RPs can use any of
	<xref target="OpenID.Session">OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0</xref>,
	<xref target="OpenID.FrontChannel">OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0</xref>,
	and/or
	<xref target="OpenID.BackChannel">OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0</xref>
	to receive logout notifications from the OP,
	depending upon which of these mechanisms the OP and RPs mutually support.
	The RP initiating the logout is to be included in these notifications
	before the post-logout redirection defined in
	<xref target="RedirectionAfterLogout"/> is performed.
      </t>
      <t>
	It is up to the RP whether to locally log out the End-User
	before redirecting the User Agent to the OP's Logout Endpoint.
	On one hand, if the End-User approves the logout at the OP,
	the RP initiating the logout should receive a logout message from the OP
	and can perform a local logout at that time.
	On the other hand, some logout notification methods from the OP to the RP
	are unreliable and therefore the notification might not be received.
	Also, the End-User might not approve the OP logging out,
	in which case the RP would not receive a logout notification.
      </t>

      <section anchor="OPMetadata" title="OpenID Provider Discovery Metadata">
	<t>
	  To support OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout, the RP needs to obtain
	  the RP-Initiated Logout related OP metadata.
	  This OP metadata is normally obtained via the OP's Discovery response,
	  as described in <xref target="OpenID.Discovery">OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0</xref>,
	  or MAY be learned via other mechanisms.
	</t>
	<t>
	  This OpenID Provider Metadata parameter MUST be included in
	  the Server's discovery responses

	<t>
	  <list style="hanging">
	    <t hangText="end_session_endpoint">

	In some cases, the RP will request that the End-User's User Agent
	to be redirected back to the RP
	after a logout has been performed.
	Post-logout redirection is only done when the logout is RP-initiated,
	in which case the redirection target is
	the <spanx style="verb">post_logout_redirect_uri</spanx> parameter
	value sent by the initiating RP.
	An <spanx style="verb">id_token_hint</spanx> carring an ID Token for the RP
	is also RECOMMENDED when requesting post-logout redirection;
	if it is not supplied with <spanx style="verb">post_logout_redirect_uri</spanx>,
	the OP MUST NOT perform post-logout redirection
	unless the OP has other means of confirming the legitimacy of the post-logout redirection target.
	The OP also MUST NOT perform post-logout redirection if the
	<spanx style="verb">post_logout_redirect_uri</spanx> value supplied does not exactly match
	one of the previously registered <spanx style="verb">post_logout_redirect_uris</spanx> values.
	The post-logout redirection is performed after the OP has finished notifying the RPs
	that logged in with the OP for that End-User that they are to log out the End-User.

      <t>
	As described in <xref target="RedirectionAfterLogout"/>,
	when the OP detects errors in the RP-Initiated Logout request,
	the OP MUST not perform post-logout redirection to an RP.
	Beyond that, the OP has discretion on what information to display to the End-User

	It MAY display an error message.
	It MAY ask the End-User whether to log out of the OP.

	Note that giving the End-User the opportunity to log out may have security benefits,

	The End-User initiating a logout action at the RP may expect to be completely logged out,

	Not giving the End-User the opportunity to log out at the OP
