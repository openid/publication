<?line 88?>

<t>The Authorization API enables Policy Decision Points (PDPs) and Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs) to communicate authorization requests and decisions to each other without requiring knowledge of each other's inner workings. The Authorization API is served by the PDP and is called by the PEP. The Authorization API includes an Evaluation endpoint, which provides specific access decisions. Other endpoints may be added in the future for other scenarios, including searching for subjects or resources.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>Computational services often implement access control within their components by separating Policy Decision Points (PDPs) from Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs). PDPs and PEPs are defined in XACML (<xref target="XACML"/>) and NIST's ABAC SP 800-162 (<xref target="ABAC"/>). Communication between PDPs and PEPs follows similar patterns across different software and services that require or provide authorization information. The Authorization API described in this document enables different providers to offer PDP and PEP capabilities without having to bind themselves to one particular implementation of a PDP or PEP.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="model"><name>Model</name>
<t>The Authorization API is a transport-agnostic API published by the PDP, to which the PEP acts as a client. Possible bindings of this specification, such as HTTPS or gRPC, are described in Transport (<xref target="transport"/>).</t>

<t>Authorization for the Authorization API itself is out of scope for this document, since authorization for APIs is well-documented elsewhere. For example, the Authorization API's HTTPS binding MAY support authorization using an <spanx style="verb">Authorization</spanx> header, using a <spanx style="verb">basic</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">bearer</spanx> token. Support for OAuth 2.0 (<xref target="RFC6749"/>) is RECOMMENDED.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="features"><name>Features</name>
<t>The core feature of the Authorization API is the Access Evaluation API, which enables a PEP to find out if a specific request can be permitted to access a specific resource. The following are non-normative examples:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Can Alice view document #123?</t>
  <t>Can Alice view document #123 at 16:30 on Tuesday, June 11, 2024?</t>
  <t>Can a manager print?</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="api-version"><name>API Version</name>
<t>This document describes the API version 1. Any updates to this API through subsequent revisions of this document or other documents MAY augment this API, but MUST NOT modify the API described here. Augmentation MAY include additional API methods or additional parameters to existing API methods, additional authorization mechanisms, or additional optional headers in API requests. All API methods for version 1 MUST be immediately preceded by the relative URL path <spanx style="verb">/v1/</spanx>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="information-model"><name>Information Model</name>
<t>The information model for requests and responses include the following entities: Subject, Action, Resource, Context, and Decision. These are all defined below.</t>

<section anchor="subject"><name>Subject</name>
<t>A Subject is the user or robotic principal about whom the Authorization API is being invoked. The Subject may be requesting access at the time the Authorization API is invoked.</t>

<t>A Subject is a JSON (<xref target="RFC8259"/>) object that contains any number of key-value pair attributes. However, there are a minimal number of fields that are required in order to properly resolve a Subject.</t>

<dl>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">type</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>REQUIRED. A <spanx style="verb">string</spanx> value that specifies the type of the Subject.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">id</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>REQUIRED. The unique identifier of the Subject, scoped to the <spanx style="verb">type</spanx>.</t>
  </dd>
</dl>

<t>A Subject MAY contain zero or more additional key-value pairs.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a subject:</t>

<figure title="Example Subject" anchor="subject-example"><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[
{
  "type": "user",
  "id": "alice@acmecorp.com"
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<section anchor="subject-identifier"><name>Subject Identifier</name>
<t>The <spanx style="verb">id</spanx> field of a Subject MAY be any valid JSON value. It MAY be a string, or it MAY be a structured identifier. For example, it MAY follow the format specified by the <spanx style="verb">Subject Identifiers for Security Event Tokens</spanx> specification <xref target="RFC9493"/>.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a Subject Identifier as a simple string:</t>

<figure title="Example of Simple Subject Identifier" anchor="subject-identifier-example-simple"><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[
{
  "type": "user",
  "id": "alice@acmecorp.com"
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a Subject Identifier in the <xref target="RFC9493"/> Email Identifier Format:</t>

<figure title="Example Subject Identifier as RFC9493 Subject" anchor="subject-identifier-example-rfc9493"><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[
{
  "type": "user",
  "id": {
    "format" : "email",
    "email": "alice@acmecorp.com"
  }
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

</section>
<section anchor="subject-type"><name>Subject Type</name>
<t>Since <xref target="RFC9493"/> only concerns itself with the <em>format</em> of the identifier and not its <em>type</em>, every Subject MUST also include a string-valued <spanx style="verb">type</spanx> field, which identifies the type of Subject.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a Subject of type <spanx style="verb">group</spanx> with a Subject Identifier as a simple string:</t>

<figure title="Example Group Subject Type" anchor="subject-type-group-example"><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[
{
  "type": "group",
  "id": "engineering@acmecorp.com"
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a Subject of type <spanx style="verb">group</spanx> with a Subject Identifier in the <xref target="RFC9493"/> Email Identifier Format:</t>

<figure title="Example Subject Type in RFC9493 Format" anchor="subject-type-example-rfc-9493"><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[
{
  "type": "group",
  "id": {
    "format" : "email",
    "email": "engineering@acmecorp.com"
  }
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

</section>
<section anchor="subject-attributes"><name>Subject Attributes</name>
<t>Many authorization systems are stateless, and expect the client (PEP) to pass in any attributes that are expected to be used in the evaluation of the authorization policy. To satisfy this requirement, Subjects MAY include zero or more additional attributes as key-value pairs.</t>

<t>An attribute can be single-valued or multi-valued. It can be a primitive type (string, boolean, number) or a complex type such as a JSON object or JSON array.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a Subject which adds a string-valued <spanx style="verb">department</spanx> attribute:</t>

<figure title="Example Subject with Additional Attribute" anchor="subject-department-example"><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[
{
  "type": "user",
  "id": "alice@acmecorp.com",
  "department": "Sales"
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<t>To increase interoperability, a few common attributes are specified below:</t>

<section anchor="subject-ip-address"><name>IP Address</name>
<t>The IP Address of the Subject, identified by an <spanx style="verb">ip_address</spanx> field, whose value is a textual representation of an IP Address, as defined in <spanx style="verb">Textual Conventions for Internet Network Addresses</spanx> <xref target="RFC4001"/>.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a subject which adds the <spanx style="verb">ip_address</spanx> attribute:</t>

<figure title="Example Subject with IP Address" anchor="subject-ip-address-example"><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[
{
  "type": "user",
  "id": "alice@acmecorp.com",
  "department": "Sales",
  "ip_address": "172.217.22.14"
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

</section>
<section anchor="subject-device-id"><name>Device ID</name>
<t>The Device Identifier of the Subject, identified by a <spanx style="verb">device_id</spanx> field, whose value is a string representation of the device identifier.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of a subject which adds the <spanx style="verb">device_id</spanx> attribute:</t>

<figure title="Example Subject with Device ID" anchor="subject-device-id-example"><sourcecode type="json"><![CDATA[
{

  <dd>
    <t>REQUIRED. The unique identifier of the Resource, scoped to the <spanx style="verb">type</spanx>. The value MAY be any valid JSON value, including a simple string. It also MAY follow the format specified by the <spanx style="verb">Subject Identifiers for Security Event Tokens</spanx> specification <xref target="RFC9493"/>.</t>
  </dd>
</dl>

<section anchor="examples-non-normative"><name>Examples (non-normative)</name>

</section>
<section anchor="action"><name>Action</name>
<t>An Action is the type of access that the requester intends to perform.</t>

<t>Action is a JSON (<xref target="RFC8259"/>) object that contains at least a <spanx style="verb">name</spanx> field.</t>

<dl>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">name</spanx>:</dt>
  <dd>

<section anchor="common-action-values"><name>Common Action Values</name>
<t>Since many services follow a Create-Read-Update-Delete convention, a set of common Actions are defined. That said, an Action may be specific to the application being accessed or shared across applications but not listed in the common Actions below.</t>

<t>The following common Actions are defined:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><spanx style="verb">can_access</spanx>: A generic Action that could mean any type of access. This is useful if the policy or application is not interested in different decisions for different types of Actions.</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">can_create</spanx>: The Action to create a new entity, which MAY be defined by the <spanx style="verb">resource</spanx> field in the request.</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">can_read</spanx>: The Action to read the content. Based on the Resource being accessed, this could mean a list functionality or reading an individual Resource's contents.</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">can_update</spanx>: The Action to update the content of an existing Resource. This represents a partial update or an entire replacement of an entity that MAY be identified by the Resource in the request.</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">can_delete</spanx>: The Action to delete a Resource. The specific entity MAY be identified by the Resource in the request.</t>
</list></t>

<t>PDP Policies MAY incorporate common Action names to provide different decisions based on the Action.</t>

<t>The following error responses are common to all methods of the Authorization API. The error response is indicated by an HTTPS status code (<xref section="15" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9110"/>) that indicates error.</t>

<t>The following errors are indicated by the status codes defined below:</t>

<texttable title="HTTPS Error status codes" anchor="_table-error-status-codes">

<t>Note: HTTPS errors are returned by the PDP to indicate an error condition relating to the request or its processing, and are unrelated to the outcome of an authorization decision, which is always returned with a <spanx style="verb">200</spanx> status code and a response payload.</t>

<t>To make this concrete:
* a <spanx style="verb">401</spanx> HTTPS status code indicates that the caller (policy enforcement point) did not properly authenticate to the PDP - for example, by omitting a required <spanx style="verb">Authorization</spanx> header, or using an invalid access token.
* the PDP indicates to the caller that the authorization request is denied by sending a response with a <spanx style="verb">200</spanx> HTTPS status code, along with a payload of <spanx style="verb">{ "decision": false }</spanx>.</t>

<section anchor="request-identification-in-a-response"><name>Request Identification in a Response</name>
<t>A PDP responding to an Authorization API request that contains an <spanx style="verb">X-Request-ID</spanx> header MUST include a request identifier in the response. The request identifier is specified in the HTTPS Response header: <spanx style="verb">X-Request-ID</spanx>. If the PEP specified a request identifier in the request, the PDP MUST include the same identifier in the response to that request.</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of an HTTPS Response with this header:</t>

<section anchor="communication-integrity-and-confidentiality"><name>Communication Integrity and Confidentiality</name>

<t>In the ABAC architecture, the PEP-PDP connection is the most sensitive one and needs to be secured to guarantee:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Integrity</t>
  <t>Confidentiality</t>
</list></t>

<t>As a result, the connection between the PEP and the PDP MUST be secured using the most adequate means given the choice of transport (e.g. TLS for HTTP REST).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="policy-confidentiality-and-sender-authentication"><name>Policy Confidentiality and Sender Authentication</name>

<t>Additionally, the PDP SHOULD authenticate the calling PEP. There are several ways authentication can be established. These ways are out of scope of this specification. They MAY include:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Mutual TLS</t>
  <t>OAuth-based authentication</t>
  <t>API key</t>
</list></t>

<t>The choice and strength of either mechanism is not in scope.</t>

<t>Authenticating the PEP allows the PDP to avoid common attacks (such as DoS - see below) and/or reveal its internal policies. A malicious actor could craft a large number of requests to try and understand what policies the PDP is configured with. Requesting a client (PEP) be authenticated mitigates that risk.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="trust"><name>Trust</name>

<t>In ABAC, there is occasionally conversations around the trust between PEP and PDP: how can the PDP trust the PEP to send the right values in? This is a misplaced concern. The PDP must trust the PEP as ultimately, the PEP is the one responsible for enforcing the decision the PDP produces.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="availability-denial-of-service"><name>Availability &amp; Denial of Service</name>

<t>The PDP SHOULD apply reasonable protections to avoid common attacks tied to request payload size, the number of requests, invalid JSON, nested JSON attacks, or memory consumption. Rate limiting is one such way to address such issues.</t>
