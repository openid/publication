<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>Financial-grade API (FAPI) 2.0 is an API security profile based on the OAuth 2.0
Authorization Framework <xref target="RFC6749"></xref> and related specifications suitable for
protecting APIs in high-value scenarios. While the security profile was
initially developed with a focus on financial applications, it is designed to be
universally applicable for protecting APIs exposing high-value and sensitive
(personal and other) data, for example, in e-health and e-government
applications.</t>

<t>The keywords &quot;shall&quot;, &quot;shall not&quot;, &quot;should&quot;, &quot;should not&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, and &quot;can&quot; in
this document are to be interpreted as described in ISO Directive Part 2

<section anchor="baseline-profile"><name>Baseline Profile</name>
<t>OIDF FAPI is an API security profile based on the OAuth 2.0 Authorization
Framework <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>. This Baseline Profile aims to reach the security goals
laid out in the [Attacker Model].</t>

<section anchor="network-layer-protections"><name>Network Layer Protections</name>
<t>To protect against network attackers, clients, authorization servers, and
resource servers shall only offer TLS protected endpoints and shall establish
connections to other servers using TLS. TLS connections shall be set up to use
TLS version 1.2 or later and follow <xref target="RFC7525"></xref>.</t>
<t>Endpoints for the use by web browsers shall use methods to ensure that
connections cannot be downgraded using TLS Stripping attacks. A preloaded
<xref target="preload"></xref> HTTP Strict Transport Security policy <xref target="RFC6797"></xref> can be used for
this purpose. Some top-level domains, like .bank and .insurance, have set such a
policy and therefore protect all second-level domains below them.</t>
<t>For a comprehensive protection against network attackers, all endpoints should
additionally use DNSSEC to protect against DNS spoofing attacks that can lead to
the issuance of rogue domain-validated TLS certificates. Note: Even if an
endpoint uses only organization validated (OV) or extended validation (EV) TLS
certificates, rogue domain-validated certificates can be used to impersonate the
endpoints and conduct man-in-the-middle attacks. CAA records <xref target="RFC8659"></xref> can
help to mitigate this risk.</t>

<li><t>shall reject pushed authorization requests without client authentication</t>
</li>
<li><t>shall support the <tt>authorization_details</tt> parameter according to
<xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-rar"></xref> to convey the authorization clients want to obtain if
the <tt>scope</tt> parameter is not expressive enough for that purpose</t>
</li>
<li><t>shall support confidential clients as defined in <xref target="RFC6749"></xref></t>
</li>
<li><t>shall only issue sender-constrained access tokens using one of the following
methods:</t>

<li><t>shall not transmit authorization responses over unencrypted network
 connections, and, to this end, shall not allow redirect URIs that use the
 &quot;http&quot; scheme except for native clients that use Loopback Interface
 Redirection as described in <xref target="RFC8252"></xref>, Section 7.3,</t>
</li>
<li><t>shall reject an authorization code (section 1.3.1 of <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>) if it has
 been previously used</t>
</li>
<li><t>shall provide a means for resource servers to verify the validity,
 integrity, sender-constraining, scope (incl. <tt>authorization_details</tt>),
 expiration and revocation status of an access token, either by providing an
 introspection endpoint <xref target="RFC7662"></xref>, by exposing signature verification
 keys, or by deployment-specific means.</t>
</li>
<li><t>shall not use the HTTP 307 status code when redirecting a request that contains
 user credentials to avoid forwarding the credentials to a third party accidentally
 (see section 4.11 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-security-topics]);</t>

</ol>
<t><strong>NOTE</strong>: In order to facilitate interoperability the authorization server should also
accept  its token endpoint URL or the URL of the endpoint at which the assertion was
received in the <tt>aud</tt> claim received in client authentication assertions.</t>
<t><strong>NOTE</strong>: If replay identification of the authorization code is not possible, it
is desirable to set the validity period of the authorization code to one minute
or a suitable short period of time. The validity period may act as a cache
control indicator of when to clear the authorization code cache if one is used.</t>
<t><strong>NOTE</strong>: To enable an interoperable solution to consent management it is anticipated that
future versions of this specification will reference the FAPI WG's Grant Management API.</t>
