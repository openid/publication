            OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 - draft 12

Abstract

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   protocol.  It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
   based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
   well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
   interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This document describes how to manage sessions for OpenID Connect,
   including when to log out the user.

1.  Introduction

   This specification complements the OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 and
   OpenID Connect Standard 1.0 specifications by defining how to monitor
   the user's login status at the OpenID Provider on an ongoing basis so
   that the Relying Party can log out the user once the user has logged
   out of the OpenID Provider.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are
   to be taken literally.  When using these values in protocol messages,
   the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Refresh Token",
   "Authorization Code", "Authorization Grant", "Authorization Server",
   "Authorization Endpoint", "Client", "Client Identifier", "Client
   Secret", "Protected Resource", "Resource Owner", "Resource Server",
   and "Token Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], and the terms
   defined by OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 [OpenID.Messages].

   This specification also defines the following term:

   Session  Instance of an interactive logged-in session at a Relying
      Party with a particular OpenID Provider and End-User identity.

2.  Endpoint Discovery

   To support OpenID Connect session management, the RP needs to obtain
   the session management related endpoint URLs.  This can either be
   communicated out of band or through the OP configuration file, as
   described in OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 [OpenID.Discovery].

   The OP endpoints defined in this specification are as follows:

   check_session_iframe  URL of an OP iframe that supports cross-origin
      communications for session state information with the RP Client,
      using the HTML 5 postMessage API.  The page is loaded from an
      invisible iframe embedded in an RP page so that it can run in the
      OP's security context.  It accepts postMessage requests from the
      relevant RP iframe and uses postMessage to post back the login
      status of the user at the OP.

   end_session_endpoint  URL at the OP that an RP can redirect the user
      to log out at the OP.

3.  Creating and Updating Sessions

   In OpenID Connect, the session at the RP typically starts when the RP
   validates the user's ID Token.  Refer to the OpenID Connect Messages
   1.0 [OpenID.Messages] and OpenID Connect Standard 1.0
   [OpenID.Standard] specifications to find out how to obtain an ID
   Token and validate it.  When the OP supports session management, it
   MUST also return the Session State as an additional "session_state"
   parameter in the Authorization Response.  An OpenID Connect
   Authorization Response is specified in Section 2.1.2 of OpenID
   Connect Messages 1.0.

   This parameter is:

   session_state  Session State.  JSON string that represents the user's
      login state at the OP.  This string is opaque to the RP.  This is
      REQUIRED if session management is supported.

4.  Session Status Change Notification

   ID Token typically comes with the expiry date.  The RP MAY rely on it
   to expire the RP session.  However, it is entirely possible that the
   user may have logged out of the OP before the expiry date.
   Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to find out the login
   status of the user at the OP.

   To do so, it is possible to repeat the authentication request with
   prompt=none.  However, this causes network traffic and this is
   problematic on the mobile devices that are increasingly becoming
   popular.  Therefore, once the session is established with the
   authentication request and response, it is desirable to be able to
   check the login status at the OP without causing network traffic by
   polling the hidden OP iframe from a RP iframe with origin restricted
   postMessage as follows.

4.1.  OP iframe

   The RP typically loads an invisible OP iframe in the page from the
   OP's "check_session_iframe".

   The RP MUST assign an "id" attribute to the iframe so that it can
   address it later.

   The OP iframe MUST enforce that the caller has the same origin as its
   parent frame.  It MUST reject postMessage requests from any other
   source origin.

   The postMessage from the RP iframe delivers the concatenation of the
   following, as the data:

   o  Client ID + " " + Session State

   The OP frame has access to Browser state at the OP (in a cookie or in
   HTML5 storage) that it uses to calculate and compare the OP session
   state that was passed by the RP.

   The OP iframe MUST recalculate it from the previously obtained Client
   ID, the source origin URL (from the postMessage), and the current OP
   Browser state.  If the received value and the calculated value do not
   match, then the OP iframe MUST postMessage the string "changed" back
   to the source.  If it matched, then it MUST postMessage the string
   "unchanged".

   Following is non-normative example pseudo-code for the OP iframe:





de Medeiros, et al.                                             [Page 6]

                  OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0       March 2013


     window.addEventListener("message", receiveMessage, false);

     function receiveMessage(e){ // e has client_id and session_state
       // Validate message origin
       var salt;
       client_id = message.split(' ')[0];
       session_state = message.split(' ')[1];
       salt = session_state.split('.')[1];
       var opbs = get_op_browser_state();
       var ss = CryptoJS.SHA256(client_id + ' ' + e.origin + ' ' +
         opbs + [' ' + salt]) [+ "." + salt];
       if (e.session_state == ss) {
         stat = 'unchanged';
       } else {
         stat = 'changed';
       }

       e.source.postMessage(stat, e.origin);
     };

   The OP browser state is typically going to be stored in a cookie or
   HTML5 local storage.  It is origin bound to the Authorization Server.
   It captures meaningful events such as logins, logouts, change of
   user, change of authorization status for Clients being used by the
   end-user, etc.  Thus, the OP should update the value of the browser
   state in response to such meaningful events.  As a result, the next
   call to check_session() after such an event will return the value
   "changed".  It is recommended that the OP do not update the browser
   state too frequently in the absence of meaningful events so as to
   spare excessive network traffic at the Client in response to spurious
   "changed" events.

   The computation of the session state returned in response to
   unsuccessful Authorization Requests should, in addition to the
   browser state, incorporate sufficient randomness in the form of a
   salt so as to prevent identification of a user across successive
   calls to the OP's Authorization Endpoint.

   In the case of an authorized Client (successful Authorization
   Response), the OP should change the value of the session state
   returned to the Client under one of the following events:

   o  The set of users authenticated to the browser changes (login,
      logout, session add).

   o  The authorization status of Clients being used by the end-user
      changes.




de Medeiros, et al.                                             [Page 7]

                  OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0       March 2013


   In addition, the browser state used to verify the session state
   should change with such events.  Calls to check_session() will return
   "changed" against earlier versions of session state after such
   events.  It is recommended that the browser state should not vary too
   frequently in the absence of such events to minimize network traffic
   caused by the Client's response to "changed" notifications.

   In the case of an unsuccessful Authorization Request, the value of
   the session state returned should vary with each request.  However,
   the browser session state need not change unless a meaningful event
   happens.  In particular, many values of session state can be
   simultaneously valid, for instance by the introduction of random salt
   in the session states issued in response to unsuccessful
   Authorization Requests.

4.2.  RP iframe

   The RP also loads an invisible iframe from itself in the same page.
   This iframe MUST know the ID of the OP iframe so that it can
   postMessage to the OP iframe.

   RP iframe polls OP iframe with postMessage with certain interval
   suitable for the RP application.  With each postMessage, it sends the
   session state defined in Section 4.1.  It also has to be able to
   receive the postMessage back from the OP iframe.  The received data
   would either be "changed" or "unchanged".  Upon receipt of "changed",
   the RP MUST perform the re-authentication with "prompt=none" to find
   the current session state at the OP.

   Following is non-normative example pseudo-code for the RP iframe:





















de Medeiros, et al.                                             [Page 8]

                  OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0       March 2013


     var stat = "unchanged";
     var mes = client_id + " " + session_state;

     function check_session()
     {
       var targetOrigin  = "http://server.example.com";
       var win = window.parent.document.getElementById("op").
                   contentWindow;
       win.postMessage( mes, targetOrigin);
     }

     function setTimer()
     {
       check_session();
       timerID = setInterval("check_session()",3*1000);
     }

     window.addEventListener("message", receiveMessage, false);

     function receiveMessage(e)
     {
       var targetOrigin  = "http://server.example.com";
       if (e.origin !== targetOrigin ) {return;}
       stat = e.data;

       if stat == "changed" then take the actions below...
     }

   When the RP detects a session state change, it should first try an
   immediate mode request within an iframe to obtain a new ID Token and
   session state, sending the old ID Token as the "id_token_hint".  If
   the RP receives an ID token for the same user, it should simply
   update the value of the session state.  If it doesn't receive an ID
   token or receives an ID token for another user, then it needs to
   handle this case as a logout for the original user.

   Note that the session state is origin bound.  Session state SHOULD be
   returned upon an authorization failure.

5.  RP-Initiated Logout

   Sometimes, the RP may want to notify the OP that the user has logged
   out of the site, and he may want to logout of the OP as well.  In
   this case, the RP, after having logged out the user, sends the user
   to the OP's logout endpoint URL that is either advertised through
   OP's provider configuration information or via out of band knowledge.

   Upon receipt of such message, the OP SHOULD prompt the user whether
   he wants to logout of the OP as well.  If the user says "yes", then
   the OP MUST log the user out.

5.1.  Redirection to RP After Logout

   In some cases, the RP may want the user to be redirected back to the
   RP after a logout has been performed.  This specification defines an
   additional dynamic registration parameter for this purpose, per
   Section 2.1 of OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0
   [OpenID.Registration].

   post_logout_redirect_uri  OPTIONAL.  URL supplied by the RP to
      request that the user be redirected to this location after a
      logout has been performed.  If supplied, the OP SHOULD honor this
      request following a logout initiated from this RP.

6.  Validation

   If any of the validation procedures defined in this specification
   fail, any operations requiring the information that failed to
   correctly validate MUST be aborted and the information that failed to
   validate MUST NOT be used.

7.  Implementation Considerations

   This specification defines features used by both Relying Parties and
   OpenID Providers that choose to implement Session Management.  All of
   these Relying Parties and OpenID Providers MUST implement the
   features that are listed in this specification as being "REQUIRED" or
   are described with a "MUST".  No other implementation considerations
   for implementations of Session Management are defined by this
   specification.

                  OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0       March 2013


8.  Security Considerations

   The OP iframe MUST enforce that the caller has the same origin as its
   parent frame.  It MUST reject postMessage requests from any other
   source origin, to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
