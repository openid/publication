1.  Introduction

   This specification is based on RISC Profile [RISC-PROFILE] and uses
   the subject identifiers defined there.

   The "aud" claim identifies the OAuth 2 client and its value SHOULD be
   the OAuth 2 [RFC6749] client id.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  OAuth Specific Subject Identifier Types

   This section defines OAuth specific Subject Identifier Types.
   Subject identifiers are defined in Section 2 of [RISC-PROFILE].

2.1.  Token Subject Identifier Type

   A Token Subject Identifier Type describes an OAuth 2 token subject
   and it is identified by the name "oauth_token".

   Subject Identifiers of this type MUST contain the following claims:

   o  token_type - required, describes the OAuth 2 token type.  Possible
      values:

      *  access_token

      *  authorization_code

      *  refresh_token

   o  token_identifier_alg - required, describes how is the token string
      in the "token" attribute to be interpreted.  Possible values:

      *  plain - plain token string

      *  prefix - token string prefix

      *  hash_* - token string hash, actual hash algorithms added as a
         suffix.  TODO: create individual values for each hash
         algorithm.

   o  token - required, the token identifier, as described by
      "token_identifier_alg".

   "subject": {
     "subject_type": "oauth_token",
     "token_type": "refresh_token",
     "token_identifier_alg": "plain",
     "token": "7265667265736820746F6B656E20737472696E67"
   }

             Figure 1: Example: Token Subject Identifier Type

2.2.  Client Subject Identifier Type

   A Client Subject Identifier Type describes an OAuth 2 client subject
   and it is identified by the name "oauth_client".

   Subjects identifiers of this type MUST contain the following claim:

   o  client_id - required, the OAuth 2 client id.

   "subject": {
     "subject_type": "oauth_client",
     "client_id": "636C69656E74206964"
   }

3.  Event Types

   The base URI for OAuth Event Types is:
   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/oauth/event-type/

3.1.  Token Issued

   Event Type URI:
   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/oauth/event-type/token-issued

   Token Issued signals that a new token was issued.

   Attributes:

   o  subject - required, a Subjectect Identifier as defined by
      Section 2.1 that identifies the token.

   o  token_subject - optional, a Subject Identifier as defined by
      Section 2.1 of [RISC-PROFILE] that identifies the account
      associated with the token.

   o  TODO: OAuth flow and endpoints involved in the process?  For
      example: redirect_uri, response_type, origin?

   The token SHOULD be uniquely identified by the provided attributes,
   either by "subject" alone or by "subject" in combination with
   "token_subject".  The token is unique in the context of a given
   Transmitter and not globally unique.  TODO: do we need a "iss"
   attribute for the "oauth_token" Subject Type?

     "iss": "https://idp.example.com/",

3.2.  Token Revoked

   Event Type URI:
   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/oauth/event-type/token-revoked

   Token Revoked signals that the token identified by this event was
   revoked.

   Attributes:

   o  subject - required, a Subjectect Identifier as defined by
      Section 2.1 that identifies the token.

   o  token_subject - optional, a Subject Identifier as defined by
      Section 2.1 of [RISC-PROFILE] that identifies the account
      associated with the token.

   o  reason - optional, the reason why the token was revoked.  Possible
      values:

      *  inactive - token was revoked by the issuer because of
         inactivity

      *  too_many - token was revoked by the issuer because an internal
         limit was reached

      *  api - token was revoked through an API call like [RFC7009]

      *  user - token was revoked explicitly by the user

      *  issuer - token was revoked by the issuer for some other reason

      *  TODO: add extension mechanism (either through URIs or IANA
         registry)

   The token SHOULD be uniquely identified by the provided attributes,
   either by "subject" alone or by "subject" in combination with
   "token_subject".  The token is unique in the context of a given
   Transmitter and not globally unique.  TODO: do we need a "iss"
   attribute for the "oauth_token" Subject Type?

      Possible values:

      *  user - all tokens were revoked explicitly by the user
