<t>OpenID Connect defines mechanism by which an End-user can leverage an OpenID Provider (OP) to release identity information (such as authentication and attributes) to a Relying Party (RP) which can act on that information.</t>
<t>This specification extends OpenID Connect with the concept of a Self-Issued OpenID Provider (Self-Issued OP), an OP which is within the End-User’s local control. End-users can leverage Self-Issued OPs to authenticate themselves and present claims directly to the Relying Parties. This allows users to interact with RPs directly, without relying on a third-party provider or requiring the End-User to operate their own hosted infrastructure.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>This specification extends OpenID Connect with the concept of a <em>Self-Issued OpenID Provider</em> (Self-Issued OP), an OP which is within the End-User’s local control. End-users can leverage Self-Issued OPs to authenticate themselves and present claims directly to Relying Parties. This allows users to interact with RPs directly, without relying on a third-party provider or requiring the End-User to operate their own hosted infrastructure.</t>
<t>An OP releases identity information such as End-user authentication in the form of an ID Token. In the case of a traditional, hosted OP, an RP will typically trust an ID token based on the relationship between the RP and OP. The OP has a reputation-based stake with both RPs and End-Users to provide correct information.</t>
<t>A <em>Self-Issued ID Token</em> is an ID Token issued by a Self-Issued OP. A Self-Issued ID Token differs in that the trust relationship is directly with the End-user.</t>
<t>Because a Self-Issued ID Token does not have the broad reputational trust of a traditional hosted OP, claims about the End-user (e.g. birthdate) are by default self-asserted and non-verifiable. Separate specifications such as <xref target="OIDC4VP"></xref> describe how to present claims from third-party sources which are cryptographically verifiable.</t>
<t>The extensions defined in this specification provide the protocol and policy-level changes needed to support this model of Self-Issued OpenID Providers. Aspects not defined in this specification are expected to continue to follow OpenID Connect Core 1.0.</t>
<t>Note: This specification replaces <eref target="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">Self-Issued OpenID Connect Provider DID Profile v0.1</eref> and was written as a working item of a liaison between Decentralized Identity Foundation and OpenID Foundation.</t>

<section anchor="use-cases"><name>Use-cases</name>

<section anchor="resilience-against-sudden-or-planned-op-unavailability"><name>Resilience against Sudden or Planned OP Unavailability</name>
<t>An OpenID Provider's infrastructure may become unavailable or even destroyed due to natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis and fires, or may be removed from service as a planned business decision. As Self-Issued OPs are local to the End-user environment, there is resilience against such events simultaneously affecting a significant portion of otherwise unimpacted End-Users.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="authentication-at-the-edge"><name>Authentication at the Edge</name>
<t>As internet-connected smartphones have risen in availability, traditionally in-person interactions and services have begun to be optimized with digital alternatives. These services often have requirements for digital authentication and for other identity credentials. Self-Issued OPs can provide this authentication directly, without needing to delegate to remote, hosted OPs. This potentially allows for increased efficiency as well as allowing for authentication in environments which may have reduced connectivity.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="sharing-credentials-from-several-issuers-in-one-transaction"><name>Sharing Credentials from Several Issuers in One Transaction</name>
<t>When End-users apply to open a banking account online, in most countries they are required to submit scanned versions of the required documents. These documents are usually issued by different authorities, and hard to be verified in a digital form. A Self-issued OP directly representing the user may have access to a greater set of such information as credentials, while a traditional OP may not have a business relationship which enables access to such a breadth of information. Self-Issued OPs could aggregate credentials from multiple sources, then release them within a single transaction to a relying party. The relying party can then verify the authenticity of the information to make the necessary business decisions.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="aggregation-of-multiple-personas-under-one-self-issued-op"><name>Aggregation of Multiple Personas under One Self-Issued Op</name>
<t>End-users often use several hosted OpenID Providers for different Relying Parties. While there are many reasons to do this, often this is done to have separately maintained identities, such as keeping a work-related persona separate from a personal persona. An End-user may do this to specifically represent different sets of claims, or because they what to prevent relying parties from correlating their activities by using the same OP. The usage of multiple OPs can create friction later, as the end-user may return later having forgot which OP they used for the relying party.</t>
<t>A single Self-Issued OP can be chosen by the End-user based on its capability to meet specific needs and privacy concerns. The separately-defined ability to present third-party credentials allows the RP to accept Self-Issued ID Tokens while still evaluating attributes using reputational trust of the credential issuers.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="scope"><name>Scope</name>
<t>As a Self-Issued OP may be running locally as a native application or progressive web application, the RP may not have a network-addressable endpoint to communicate directly with the OP. This specification leverages the implicit flow of OpenID Connect defined in Section 3.2 of <xref target="OpenID"></xref> to communicate with such locally-running OPs, and extends OpenID Connect Discovery to represent the differences from traditional OPs.</t>
<t>This document is scoped for a deployment model where the Self-Issued OP is deployed on an End-user's device.</t>
<t>This specification defines:</t>

<ul>
<li><t>Invocation of Self-Issued OP</t>
</li>
</ul>
<t>This specification defines extensions to the OpenID Connect implicit flow to invoke a Self-Issued OP from a Relying Party. It also proposes user experience behavior when no appropriate Self-Issued Op is available locally.</t>

<ul>
<li><t>Automatic Registration of supported functionality between a RP and Self-Issued OP</t>
</li>
</ul>
<t>OpenID Connect typically leverages a registration between a Client (acting as a RP) and the OP, which pre-establishes supported functionality before a request has been made. This may be done statically, or may leverage a combination of OpenID Connect Discovery and the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration Protocol.</t>
<t>In a model where each End-user is represented by a different, locally-controlled Self-Issued OP instance, Relying Parties typically cannot pre-establish registration with a Self-Issued OP. In another model, when all instances of Self-Issued OPs share the same RP registration data, it is possible for the RPs to pre-establish registration with that set of Self-Issued OPs.</t>
<t>This specification extends the authentication request with additional dynamic registration techniques.</t>

<ul>
<li><t>Additional claims and processing requirements of Self-Issued ID Tokens</t>
</li>
<li><t>Including self-asserted (non-verifiable) claims within a Self-Issued ID Token</t>
</li>
<li><t>Usage of cryptographically verifiable identifiers as a way for RPs to identify the authenticated user</t>
</li>
</ul>
<t>A <em>cryptographically verifiable identifier</em> is an identifier which is either based upon or can be resolved to cryptographic key material. Self-Issued OPs can prove possession of the underlying key during the OpenID message exchange with the RP. Future exchanges based on the same identifier serve to strongly re-authenticate the End-user.</t>
<t>This specification defines a subject syntax type which is a thumbprint of the public key material. The public key itself is shared within the ID Token as a <em>JSON Web Key</em> (JWK). The cryptographic algorithm needs to be supported by both the Self-Issued OP and RP.</t>
<t>This specification also allows for <em>resolvable identifiers</em>, which are URIs which can resolve various types of authoritative data underneath an appropriate <em>resolution method</em>. Resolvable identifiers may be used as the subject identifiers, or <tt>sub</tt> Claim of the ID Token, when they can be resolved to a set one or more of cryptographic keys that identify the subject. In addition to cryptographic algorithms, both the Self-Issued OP and RP need to support the resolution method. The resolution method is based on the URI itself, such as a &quot;https&quot; resolution method. One example of such a resolvable identifier would be a <em>Decentralized Identifier</em> (DID), where resolution methods would typically also include the <em>DID Method</em>, e.g. &quot;did:example&quot;.</t>
<t>For compatibility with the existing JWS/JWE-based cryptography of OpenID Connect, it is assumed such resolved cryptographic identities are representable as a <em>JSON Web Key Set</em> (JWKS). Each key in the set would have a cryptographic algorithm, key identifier, and associated key material.</t>
<t>The following are considered out of scope of this document:</t>

<ul>
<li><t>Presentation of aggregated credentials</t>
</li>
</ul>
<t>A traditional OP could release additional claims about the user within an ID Token such as a verified email address. The trust in the validity of the claim is based on the trust between the RP and OP.</t>
<t>A Self-Issued OP can present two types of claims - self-attested claims and claims from a third-party issuer which are cryptographically verifiable.</t>
<t>This specification relies on other specifications to define the method to present credentials from third-party issuers. One such example is <xref target="OIDC4VP"></xref>, which describes the usage of Verifiable Credentials and Verifiable Presentations with OpenID Connect.</t>

<ul>
<li><t>Provisioning of aggregated credentials</t>
</li>
</ul>
<t>The mechanism for a Self-Issued OP to acquire credentials which can be presented is out of scope of this document. Similar to presentation, a traditional OP may also wish to acquire third-party credentials to present to Relying Parties. One mechanism to provision credentials is being defined within the Claims Aggregation specification.</t>

<section anchor="discovery-and-registration"><name>Discovery and Registration</name>
<t>In conventional OpenID Connect flows, Relying Party and OpenID Provider can exchange metadata prior to the transaction, either using <xref target="OpenID.Discovery"></xref> and <xref target="OpenID.Registration"></xref>, or out-of-band mechanisms.</t>
<t>However, in Self-Issued OP flows, such mechanisms are typically not available since Self-Issued OPs do not have API endpoints for that purpose. Therefore, alternative mechanisms are adopted,  and Self-Issued OPs and Relying Parties are expected to obtain each other's metadata at every single request.</t>
<t>For Self-Issued OPs, mechanisms to obtain Relying Party metadata depend on whether the request is signed or not. When the request is not signed, metadata can be obtained from the registration parameter or using out-of-band mechanisms. When the request is signed, mechanism depends on the syntax of <tt>client_id</tt> and the resolution method used. If <tt>client_id</tt> is HTTPS URL, <tt>client_id</tt> is resolved to obtain all Relying Party metadata from an Entity Statement as defined in [OpenID.Fed], if <tt>client_id</tt> is a Decentralized Identifier, public key is obtained from a DID Doc as defined in [DID-Core] and the rest of the metadata is obtained from the registration parameter.</t>
<t>For the RPs, mechanisms to obtain Self-Issued OP metadata can be static or dynamic. A set of static metadata to be used with <tt>openid:</tt> as an <tt>authorization_endpoint</tt> is defined in this specification. If the RP knows the Self-Issued OP's Issuer Identifier, [OpenID.Discovery] or out-of-band mechanisms can be used to obtain a set of metadata including <tt>authorization_endpoint</tt> used to invoke a Self-Issued OP. Note that the RP may formulate a request that does not include <tt>authorization_endpoint</tt> if the End-user will be receiving the request with a Self-Issued OP application whose metadata the RP knows.</t>
<t>Note: How to mention requests not targeted at any authorization_endpoint. given the logic above, they would have to have performed dynamic SIOP discovery.</t>

<section anchor="self-issued-openid-provider-invocation"><name>Self-Issued OpenID Provider Invocation</name>
<t>When the End-user first interacts with the RP, there are currently no established, robust means to signal which OpenID Providers to invoke, because applications cannot reliably determine a URI of the Self-Issued OP an End-user may have a relationship with or have installed. The RP is, therefore, responsible for selecting where to direct the request URL.</t>
<t>When the RP sends the request to the Self-Issued OP, there are two scenarios how to reach and invoke an application that can process that request.</t>
<t>In the first scenario, request is encoded in a QR code, and the End-user scans it with the camera via the application that is intended to handle the request from the RP. In this scenario, the request does not need to be intended for a specfiic <tt>authorization_endpoint</tt> of a Self-Issued OP. Note that this will not work in a same-device Self-Issued OP flow, when the RP and the Self-Issued OP are on the same device.</t>
<t>In the second scenario, request includes <tt>authorization_endpoint</tt> of a Self-Issued OP, and will open a target application. In this scenario, there are two ways of how RP can obtain <tt>authorization_endpoint</tt> of the Self-Issued OP to contruct a targeted request as defined in <xref target="siop-discovery"></xref>, either using the static set of Self-Issued OP metadata, or by pre-obtaining <tt>authorization_endpoint</tt>. Note that this flow would work both for the same-device Self-Issued OP flow and the cross-device Self-Issued OP flow.</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of a request is not intended for a specific <tt>authorization_endpoint</tt> and must be scanned by the Self-Issued OP application manually opened by the End-user instead of an arbitrary camera application on a user-device (line wraps within values are for display purposes only):</t>

</section>

<section anchor="siop-discovery"><name>Self-Issued OpenID Provider Discovery</name>
<t>RP can obtain <tt>authorization_endpoint</tt> of the Self-Issued OP to contruct a request targeted to a particular application either by using the static set of Self-Issued OP metadata as defined in <xref target="siop-discovery"></xref>, or by pre-obtaining <tt>authorization_endpoint</tt> as defined in <xref target="dynamic-siop-metadata"></xref>.</t>
<t>Value of the <tt>iss</tt> Claim in the ID Token serves as an indicator which Self-Issued OP Discovery Mechanism is used.</t>

<section anchor="static-siop-metadata"><name>Static Self-Issued OpenID Provider Discovery Metadata</name>
<t>When the RP does not have the means to pre-obtain Self-Issued OP Discovery Metadata, dynamic discovery is not performed. Instead, the following static configuration values are used.</t>

<sourcecode type="json">{
  &quot;authorization_endpoint&quot;: &quot;openid:&quot;,

</sourcecode>
<t>Editor's Note: discuss whether &quot;subject<em>syntax</em>types_supported&quot; should be defined in a static SIOP Discovery Metadata.</t>
<t>RP MUST use custom URI scheme <tt>openid:</tt> as the <tt>authorization_endpoint</tt> to construct the request. Self-Issued OPs invoked via <tt>openid:</tt> MUST set issuer identifier, or <tt>iss</tt> Claim in the ID Token to <tt>https://self-issued.me/v2</tt>.</t>
<t>Note that the request using custom URI scheme <tt>openid:</tt> will open only Self-Issued OPs as native apps, and does not support Self-Issued OPs as web applications. For other types of Self-Issued OP deployments, the usage of the Universal Links, or App Links is recommended as explained in <xref target="choice-of-authoriation-endpoint"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="dynamic-siop-metadata"><name>Dynamic Self-Issued OpenID Provider Discovery Metadata</name>
<t>As an alternative mechanism to the <xref target="static-siop-metadata"></xref>, the RP can pre-obtain Self-Issued OP Discovery Metadata prior to the transaction, either using <xref target="OpenID.Discovery"></xref>, or out-of-band mechanisms.</t>
<t>How the RP obtains Self-Issued OP's issuer identifier is out of scope of this specification. The RPs MAY skip Section 2 of <xref target="OpenID.Discovery"></xref>.</t>
<t>When <xref target="OpenID.Discovery"></xref> is used, the RP MUST obtain Self-Issued OP metadata from a JSON document that Selc-Issued OP made available at the path formed by concatenating the string <tt>/.well-known/openid-configuration</tt> to the Self-Issed OP's Issuer Identifier.</t>
<t>Note that contrary to <xref target="OpenID.Discovery"></xref>, <tt>jwks_uri</tt> parameter MUST NOT be present in Self-Issued OP Metadata. If it is, the RP MUST ignore it, and use <tt>sub</tt> claim in the ID Token to obtain signing keys to validate the signatures from the Self-Issued OpenID Provider.
Note: handling of <tt>jwks_uri</tt> needs to be discussed.</t>

<t>Other Discovery parameters defined in Section 3 of <xref target="OpenID.Discovery"></xref> MAY be used.</t>
<t>The RP MUST use the <tt>authorization_endpoint</tt> defined in Self-Issued OP Discovery Metadata to construct the request. Issuer identifier of the Self-Issued OP, or <tt>iss</tt> Claim in the ID Token, MUST be the issuer identifier specified in the Discovery Metadata.</t>
<t>An additional <tt>i_am_siop</tt> Claim MUST be included in the ID Token as a way for the RP to determine if the ID Token has been issued by the Self-Issued OP, when dynamic Self-Issued OpenID Provider discovery has been used.</t>

<section anchor="choice-of-authoriation-endpoint"><name>Choice of <tt>authorization_endpoint</tt></name>
<t>As the <tt>authorization_endpoint</tt> of a Self-Issued OP, the use of Universal Links ot App Links is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> over the use of custom URI schemes.</t>
<t>The implementors are highly encouraged to explore other options before using custom URI schemes such as <tt>openid:</tt> due to the known security issues of the custom URI schemes, such as lack of controls to prevent unknown applications from attempting to service authentication requests.

<section anchor="sub-syntax-type"><name>Subject Syntax Types</name>
<t>Subject Syntax Type refers to a type of an identifier used in a <tt>sub</tt> claim in the ID Token issued by a Self-Issued OP. <tt>sub</tt> in Self-Issued OP flow serves as an identifier of the Self-Issued OP's Holder, and is used to obtain cryptographic material to verify the signature on the ID Token.</t>
<t>This specification defines the following two Subject Syntax Types. Additional Subject Syntax Types may be defined in the future versions of this specification, or profiles of this specification.</t>

<ul>
<li><t>JWK Thumbprint subject syntax type. When this type is used, the <tt>sub</tt> claim value MUST be the base64url encoded representation of the JWK thumbprint of the key in the <tt>sub_jwk</tt> claim <xref target="RFC7638"></xref>, and <tt>sub_jwk</tt> MUST be included in the Self-Issued OP response.</t>
</li>
<li><t>Decentralized Identifier subject syntax type. When this type is used,  the <tt>sub</tt> value MUST be a DID as defined in <xref target="DID-CORE"></xref>, and <tt>sub_jwk</tt> MUST NOT be included in the Self-Issued OP response. The subject syntax type MUST be cryptographicaly verified against the resolved DID Document as defined in {#siop-id_token-validation}.</t>
</li>
</ul>
<t>The RP indicates Subject Syntax Type it supports in RP Registration Metadata <tt>subject_syntax_types_supported</tt> defined in {#rp-metadata}.</t>
</section>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="rp-resolution"><name>Relying Party Registration</name>
<t>When the Self-Issed OP request is not signed, all registration parameters <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be passed using registration parameter defined in <xref target="rp-registration-parameter"></xref>, or using out-of-band mechanism. In this case, <tt>client_id</tt> <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> equal <tt>redirect_uri</tt>.</t>
<t>When the Self-Issued OP request is signed, the public key to verify the signature <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be obtained by resolving Relying Party's <tt>client_id</tt>. Depending on the Relying Party Metadata Resolution Method used, the rest of the RP Registration metadata <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be included either in the <tt>registration</tt> parameter inside the Self-Issued OP request, or in the Entity Statement as defined in OpenID Federation 1.0 Automatic Registration. In this case, <tt>client_id</tt> would not equal <tt>redirect_uri</tt>.</t>
<t><tt>registration</tt> parameters <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> include <tt>redirect_uris</tt> to prevent attackers from inserting malicious Redirection URI. If <tt>registration</tt> parameter includes <tt>redirect_uris</tt>, Self-Issued OP <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ignore it and only use <tt>redirect_uri</tt> directly supplied in the Self-Issued OP request.</t>
<t>Note that in Self-Issued OP flow, no registration response is returned. A successful authentication response implicitly indicates that the registration parameters were accepted.</t>

<section anchor="rp-registration-parameter"><name>Relying Party Registration Parameter</name>
<t>OpenID Connect defines the following negotiation parameters to enable Relying Party to provide information about itself to a Self-Issued OP that would normally be provided to an OP during Dynamic Client Registration:</t>

<ul>
<li><t><tt>registration</tt></t>

<ul>
<li><t><bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>. This parameter enables RP Registration Metadata to be passed in a single, self-contained parameter. The value is a JSON object containing RP Registration Metadata values. The registration parameter value is represented in an OAuth 2.0 request as a UTF-8 encoded JSON object (which ends up being form-urlencoded when passed as an OAuth parameter). When used in a Request Object value, per Section 6.1, the JSON object is used as the value of the registration member.</t>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><t><tt>registration_uri</tt></t>

<ul>
<li><t><bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>. This parameter enables RP Registration Metadata to be passed by reference, rather than by value. The request<em>uri value is a URL using the https scheme referencing a resource containing RP Negotiation Metadata values. The contents of the resource referenced by the URL MUST be a RP Registration Metadata Object. The scheme used in the <tt>registration_uri</tt> value MUST be https. The request</em>uri value MUST be reachable by the Self-Issued OP, and SHOULD be reachable by the RP. This parameter is used identically to the request parameter, other than that the Relying Party registration metadata value is retrieved from the resource at the specified URL.</t>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<t>If one of these parameters is used, the other MUST NOT be used in the same request.</t>
<t>RP Negotiation metadata values are defined in Section 4.3 and Section 2.1 of the OpenID Connect Dynamic RP Registration 1.0 <xref target="OpenID.Registration"></xref> specification as well as <xref target="RFC7591"></xref>.</t>
<t>Metadata parameters should preferably be sent by reference as a URI using <tt>registration_uri</tt> parameter, but when RP cannot host a webserver, metadata parameters should be sent by value using <tt>registration</tt> parameter.</t>
<t><tt>registration</tt> and <tt>registration_uri</tt> parameters SHOULD NOT be used when the OP is not a Self-Issued OP.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="rp-resolution-parameter"><name>Relying Party Metadata Resolution Methods</name>
<t>This specification defines two methods of resolving <tt>client_id</tt> of the RP to obtain RP's public key and metadata. These methods are specific to different syntaxes that the <tt>client_id</tt> may utilize.</t>
<t>Other resolution methods may be defined in the future versions of this specification or by the Trust Frameworks.</t>

<section anchor="openid-federation-1-0-automatic-registration"><name>OpenID Federation 1.0 Automatic Registration</name>
<t>When Relying Party's <tt>client_id</tt> is expressed as an <tt>https</tt> URI, Automatic Registration defined in [OpenID.Federation] MUST be used.</t>
<t>The Relying Party's Entity Identifier defined in section 1.2 of OpenID.Federation] MUST be <tt>client_id</tt>. When the Self-Issued Request is signed, Self-Issued OP MUST obtain the public key from the <tt>jwks</tt> property in the Relying Party's Entity Statement defined in section 3.1 of [OpenID.Federation]. Metadata other than the public keys MUST also be obtained from the Entity Statement.</t>
<t>Note that to use Automatic Registration, clients would be required to have an individual identifier and an associated public key(s), which is not always the case for the public/native app clients.</t>
<t>Below is a non-normative example of a <tt>client_id</tt> resolvable using OpenID Federation 1.0 Automatic Registration:</t>

<t>When the Relying Party's <tt>client_id</tt> is expressed as a <tt>did</tt> URI as defined in <xref target="DID-CORE"></xref>, a public key used to sign the request MUST be obtained from the <tt>verificationMethod</tt> property of a DID Document. Since DID Document may include multiple public keys, a particular public key used to sign the request in question MUST be identified by the <tt>kid</tt> in the header. To obtain the DID Document, Self-Issued OP MUST use DID Resolution defined by the DID method must be used by the RP.</t>
<t>RP metadata other than the public key MUST be obtained from the <tt>registration</tt> parameter as defined in {#rp-registration-parameter}.</t>

<section anchor="rp-metadata"><name>Relying Party Registration Metadata Values</name>
<t>This extension defines the following RP Registration Metadata value, used by the RP to provide information about itself to the Self-Issued OP:</t>

<ul>
<li><t><tt>subject_syntax_types_supported</tt></t>

<ul>
<li><t>REQUIRED. A JSON array of strings representing URI scheme identifiers and optionally method names of supported Subject Syntax Types defined in {#sub-syntax-type}. When Subject Syntax Type is JWK Thumbprint, valid value is <tt>urn:ietf:params:oauth:jwk-thumbprint</tt> defined in <xref target="jwk-thumbprint-uri"></xref>. When Subject Syntax Type is Decentralized Identifier, valid values MUST be a <tt>did:</tt> prefix follewd by a supported DID method without a <tt>:</tt> suffix. For example, support for the DID method with a method-name &quot;example&quot; would be represented by <tt>did:example</tt>. Support for all DID methods is indicated by sending <tt>did</tt> without any method-name.</t>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<t>Other registration parameters defined in <xref target="OpenID.Registration"></xref> MAY be used. Examples are explanatory parameters such as <tt>policy_uri</tt>, <tt>tos_uri</tt>, and <tt>logo_uri</tt>. If the RP uses more than one Redirection URI, the <tt>redirect_uris</tt> parameter would be used to register them. Finally, if the RP is requesting encrypted responses, it would typically use the <tt>jwks_uri</tt>, <tt>id_token_encrypted_response_alg</tt> and <tt>id_token_encrypted_response_enc</tt> parameters.</t>

<section anchor="siop-authentication-response"><name>Self-Issued OpenID Provider Response</name>
<t>A Self-Issued OpenID Provider Response is returned when Self-Issued OP supports all Relying Party Registration metadata values received from the Relying Party in the <tt>registration</tt> parameter. If one or more of the Relying Party Registration Metadata Values is not supported, Self-Issued OP MUST return an error according to <xref target="rp-reg-error"></xref>.</t>
<t>The response contains an ID Token and, if applicable, further response parameters as defined in extensions. As an example, the response MAY also include a VP token as defined in [OIDC4VP].</t>
<t>This extension defines the following claims to be included in the ID token for use in Self-Issued OpenID Provider Responses:</t>

<ul>
<li><t><tt>sub</tt></t>

<ul>
<li><t>REQUIRED. Subject identifier value. When Subject Syntax Type is <tt>jkt</tt>, the value is the base64url encoded representation of the thumbprint of the key in the <tt>sub_jwk</tt> Claim. When Subject Syntax Type is <tt>did</tt>, the value is a Decentralized Identifier. The thumbprint value of Subject Syntax Type <tt>jkt</tt> is computed as the SHA-256 hash of the octets of the UTF-8 representation of a JWK constructed containing only the REQUIRED members to represent the key, with the member names sorted into lexicographic order, and with no white space or line breaks. For instance, when the <tt>kty</tt> value is <tt>RSA</tt>, the member names <tt>e</tt>, <tt>kty</tt>, and <tt>n</tt> are the ones present in the constructed JWK used in the thumbprint computation and appear in that order; when the <tt>kty</tt> value is <tt>EC</tt>, the member names <tt>crv</tt>, <tt>kty</tt>, <tt>x</tt>, and <tt>y</tt> are present in that order. Note that this thumbprint calculation is the same as that defined in the JWK Thumbprint <xref target="RFC7638"></xref> specification.</t>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><t><tt>sub_jwk</tt></t>

<ul>
<li><t>OPTIONAL. A JSON object that is a public key used to check the signature of an ID Token when Subject Syntax Type is <tt>jkt</tt>. The key is a bare key in JWK [JWK] format (not an X.509 certificate value). MUST NOT be present only when Subject Syntax Type other than <tt>jkt</tt> is used.</t>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><t><tt>i_am_siop</tt></t>

<ul>
<li><t>OPTIONAL. Boolean. It MUST be set to <tt>true</tt> and be included when Self-Issued OP Discovery metadata has been obtained dynamically.
Note: The use of <tt>i_am_siop</tt> claim is under discussion and may be replaced with something like &quot;iss&quot;: &quot;siop+<eref target="https://siop.example.com&quot;">https://siop.example.com"</eref>.</t>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<t>Note that the use of the <tt>sub_jwk</tt> Claim is NOT RECOMMENDED when the OP is not Self-Issued.</t>
<t>Whether the Self-Issued OP is a mobile application or a web application, the response is the same as the normal Implicit Flow response with the following refinements. Since it is an Implicit Flow response, the response parameters will be returned in the URL fragment component, unless a different Response Mode was specified.</t>

<ol>
<li><t>The <tt>sub</tt> (subject) Claim value is either the base64url encoded representation of the thumbprint of the key in the <tt>sub_jwk</tt> Claim or a Decentralized Identifier.</t>
</li>
<li><t>When <tt>sub</tt> Claim value is the base64url encoded representation of the thumbprint, a <tt>sub_jwk</tt> Claim is present, with its value being the public key used to check the signature of the ID Token.</t>
</li>
<li><t>No Access Token is returned for accessing a UserInfo Endpoint, so all Claims returned MUST be in the ID Token.</t>

<t>Self-Issued OP and the RP that wish to support request and presentation of Verifiable Presentations MUST be compliant with OpenID Connect for Verifiable Presentations <xref target="OIDC4VP"></xref> and W3C Verifiable Credentials Specification [VC-DATA].</t>
<t>Verifiable Presentation is a tamper-evident presentation encoded in such a way that authorship of the data can be trusted after a process of cryptographic verification. Certain types of verifiable presentations might contain selectively disclosed data that is synthesized from, but does not contain, the original verifiable credentials (for example, zero-knowledge proofs).

<section anchor="siop-id-token-validation"><name>Self-Issued ID Token Validation</name>
<t>See <xref target="OIDC4VP"></xref> on how to support multiple credential formats such as JWT and Linked Data Proofs.</t>
<t>To validate the ID Token received, the RP MUST do the following:</t>

<ol>
<li><t>The Relying Party (RP) MUST determine whether the ID Token has been issued by the Self-Issued OP. When static Self-Issued OP Discovery metadata has been used, <tt>iss</tt> MUST be <tt>https://self-issued.me/v2</tt>. When Self-Issued OP Discovery metadata has been obtained dynamically, an additional <tt>i_am_siop</tt> Claim MUST be present in the ID Token and <tt>iss</tt> MUST exactly match the <tt>issuer</tt> identifier specified in the Self-Issued OP Discovery Metadata MUST be included in the ID Token as a way for the RP to determine if the, when dynamic Self-Issued OpenID Provider discovery has been used.</t>
</li>
<li><t>The RP MUST validate that the <tt>aud</tt> (audience) Claim contains the value of the <tt>client_id</tt> that the RP sent in the Authentication Request as an audience. When the request has been signed, the value might be an HTTPS URL, or a Decentralized Identifier.</t>
</li>
<li><t>The RP MUST identify which Subject Syntax Type is used. If the <tt>sub</tt> claim is a decentralized identifier, the Subject Syntax Type is <tt>did</tt>. If the <tt>sub</tt> claims is NOT a decentralized identifier, and a <tt>sub_jwk</tt> claim is present, the Subject Syntax Type is <tt>jwk</tt>.
Note: needs further discussion.</t>
</li>
<li><t>The RP MUST validate the signature of the ID Token. When Subject Syntax Type is <tt>jkt</tt>, validation is done according to JWS [JWS] using the algorithm specified in the <tt>alg</tt> header parameter of the JOSE Header, using the key in the <tt>sub_jwk</tt> Claim. The key MUST be a bare key in JWK format (not an X.509 certificate value). The RP MUST validate that the algorithm is one of the allowed algorithms (as in <tt>id_token_signing_alg_values_supported</tt>). When Subject Syntax Type is <tt>did</tt>, validation is performed against the key obtained from a DID Document. DID Document MUST be obtained by resolving a Decentralized Identifier included in the <tt>sub</tt> claim using DID Resolution as defined by a DID Method specification of the DID Method used. Since <tt>verificationMethod</tt> property in the DID Document may contian multiple public key sets, public key identified by a key identifier <tt>kid</tt> in a Header of a signed ID Token MUST be used to validate that ID Token.</t>
</li>
<li><t>The RP MUST validate the <tt>sub</tt> value. When Subject Syntax Type is <tt>jkt</tt>, the RP MUST validate that the <tt>sub</tt> claim value equals the base64url encoded representation of the thumbprint of the key in the <tt>sub_jwk</tt> Claim, as specified in <xref target="siop-authentication-response"></xref>. When Subject Syntax Type is <tt>did</tt>, the RP MUST validate that the <tt>sub</tt> claim value equals the <tt>id</tt> property in the DID Document.</t>
</li>
<li><t>The current time MUST be before the time represented by the <tt>exp</tt> Claim (possibly allowing for some small leeway to account for clock skew).
The <tt>iat</tt> Claim can be used to reject tokens that were issued too far away from the current time, limiting the amount of time that nonces need to be stored to prevent attacks. The acceptable range is RP-specific.</t>
</li>
<li><t>The RP MUST validate that a <tt>nonce</tt> Claim is present and is the same value as the one that was sent in the Authentication Request. The Client MUST check the <tt>nonce</tt> value for replay attacks. The precise method for detecting replay attacks is RP specific.</t>
</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section anchor="cross-device-siop"><name>Cross-Device SIOP</name>
<t>This section describes how SIOP is used in cross-device scenarios. In contrast to on-device scenarios, neither RP nor SIOP can communicate to each other via HTTP redirects through a user agent. The flow is therefore modified as follows:</t>

<ol>
<li><t>The RP prepares a SIOP request and renders it as a QR code.</t>
</li>
<li><t>The user scans the QR code with her smartphone's camera app.</t>
</li>
<li><t>The standard mechanisms for invoking the SIOP are used on the smartphone (based on the <tt>openid</tt> custom scheme).</t>
</li>
<li><t>The SIOP processes the authentication request.</t>
</li>
<li><t>Upon completion of the authentication request, the SIOP directly sends a HTTP POST request with the authentication response to an endpoint exposed by the RP.</t>
</li>
</ol>
<t>Note: The request in Step 5 is not a form post request where the SIOP would respond to a user agent with a form, which automatically triggers a POST request to the RP. The SIOP sends this request directly to the RP's endpoint.</t>

<section anchor="authentication-request"><name>Authentication Request</name>
<t>The cross-device authentication request differs from the on-device variant as defined in <xref target="siop_authentication_request"></xref> as follows:</t>

<ul>
<li><t>This specification introduces a new response mode <tt>post</tt> in accordance with [OIDM]. This response mode is used to request the SIOP to deliver the result of the authentication process to a certain endpoint. The additional parameter <tt>response_mode</tt> is used to carry this value.</t>
</li>
<li><t>This endpoint the SIOP shall deliver the authentication result to is conveyed in the standard parameter <tt>redirect_uri</tt>.</t>
</li>
<li><t>The RP MUST ensure the <tt>nonce</tt> value used for a particular transaction is available at this endpoint for security checks.</t>

<t>Here is an example of an authentication request URL:</t>

<artwork>    openid://?
    response_type=id_token
    &amp;response_mode=post
    &amp;client_id=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb

    %22id_token_signing_alg_values_supported%22:%5B%22RS256%22%5D%7D
</artwork>
<t>Note that the authentication request might only include request parameters and not be targeted to a particular <tt>authorization_endpoint</tt>, in which case, ther user must use particular Self-Issued OP application to scan the QR code with such request.</t>
<t>Note: Such an authentication request might result in a large QR code, especially when including a <tt>claims</tt> parameter and extensive registration data. A RP MAY consider to use a <tt>request_uri</tt> in such a case.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="authentication-response"><name>Authentication Response</name>
<t>The SIOP sends the authentication response to the endpoint passed in the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> authentication request parameter using a HTTP POST request using &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot; encoding. The authentication response contains the parameters as defined in <xref target="siop-authentication-response"></xref>.</t>
<t>The following shows a non-normative example of an authentication response:</t>

<sourcecode type="http">  POST /cb HTTP/1.1
  Host: client.example.com
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

  &amp;id_token=eyJ0 ... NiJ9.eyJ1c ... I6IjIifX0.DeWt4Qu ... ZXso
</sourcecode>
</section>

<section anchor="id-token-validation"><name>ID Token Validation</name>
<t>The RP MUST perform all the check as defined in <xref target="siop-id-token-validation"></xref>.</t>
<t>Additionally, the RP MUST check whether the <tt>nonce</tt> claim value provided in the ID Token is known to the RP and was not used before in an authentication response.</t>

<section anchor="usage-of-self-issued-op-for-authentication"><name>Usage of Self-Issued OP for Authentication</name>
<t>A known attack in cross-device SIOP is a session replay attack, where a victim is tricked to send a response to a request that an RP has generated for an attacker. Attacker would trick a victim to respond to a request that an attacker has generated for him/herself at a good RP.</t>
<t>Implementors should be cautious when using cross-device Self-Issued OP model for Authentication, and should implement mitigations according to the desired security level.</t>
<t>This attack does not apply for the same-device Self-Issued OP flows, and they can be used for Authentication, given all other security measure are put in place.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="invocation-using-custom-schema"><name>Invocation using Custom Schema</name>
<t>Usage of custom schemas as a way to invoke a Self-Issued OP may lead to phishing attacks and undefined behavior.</t>
<t>Custom schema is a mechanism offered by Mobile Operating System providers. If an application developer registers custom schema with the application, that application will be invoked when a request containing custom schema is received by the device.</t>
<t>Any malicious app can register the custom schema already used by another app, imitate the user interface and impersonate a good app.</t>
<t>When more than one Self-issued OP with the same custom schema has been installed on one device, the behavior of Self-Issued OP is undefined.</t>

<section anchor="selective-disclosure-and-un-linkable-presentations"><name>Selective disclosure and un-linkable presentations</name>
<t>Usage of decentralized identifiers does not automatically prevent possible RP correlation. If a status check of the presentation is done, IdP / SIOP correlation can occur.</t>
<t>Consider supporting selective disclosure and un-linkable presentations using zero-knowledge proofs or single-use credentials instead of traditional correlatable signatures.</t>

<section anchor="implementation-considerations"><name>Implementation Considerations</name>

<section anchor="supporing-multiple-self-issued-ops"><name>Supporing multiple Self-Issued OPs</name>
<t>When the RP wants to provide End-user choice to select from multiple possible Self-Issued OPs, it MAY present a static list of the supported options. This is similar to the process of supporting multiple different social networks represented as traditional OPs.</t>
<t>Note that if Self-Issued OP implementations belong to a trust framework, the trust framework may dictacte a common <tt>authorization_endpoint</tt> for a set of implementations. If <tt>authorization_endpoint</tt> is pre-registered with the underlying browser or operating system, invocation of this endpoint that leads to prompting the End-user to select a Self-Issued OP is handled by the underlying browser or operating system.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="currently-known-browser-behavior"><name>Currently known browser behavior</name>
<t>The browser or operating system typically has a process by which native applications and websites can register support that one or more apps be called when a HTTPS URI is triggered in lieu of a system browser. This feature goes by several names including &quot;App Links&quot; and &quot;Universal Links&quot;, and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used to invoke an installed/registered Self-Issued OP. If no appropriate application has been rendered, the request for a Self-Issued OP will go to a browser, which MAY display additional information such as appropriate software options.</t>
<t>If the underlying browser or operating system restricts application support for HTTPS URL handling to an authoritative list, the list would be administered under the trust framework to reflect certified and/or audited implementations.
Note: clarify why authoritative list is relevant</t>
<t>Operating systems also typically have a functionality by which native applications and websites can register a preference that one or more apps be called when a URI underneath a scheme that the platform or browser allows. For custom URI scheme, there is typically no platform or other controls limiting the ability of applications to register such schemes. If no available application supports the custom URI scheme, the platform or browser will typically generate a modal error and present it to the End-User.</t>
