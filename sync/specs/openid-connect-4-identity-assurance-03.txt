Internet-Draft     openid-connect-4-identity-assurance          May 2019


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines an extension to OpenID Connect [OpenID] to
   address the use case of strong identity verification of a natural
   person in accordance with certain laws.  Examples include Anti Money
   Laundering Laws, Telecommunication Acts, Anti Terror Laws, and
   regulations on trust services, such as eIDAS [eIDAS].

   In such use cases, the Relying Parties (RPs) need to know the
   assurance level of the user Claims attested by the OpenID Connect
   Providers (OPs) along with evidences related to the identity
   verification process (identity assurance).

   Identity assurance significantly differs from authentication
   assurance, which requires a different representation in the OpenID
   Connect protocol that is defined in this specification.

   The assurance level for authentication is a property of a certain
   OpenID Connect transaction, determined by the authentication means
   employed and the underlying user account management processes.  The
   "acr" Claim as defined in Section 2 of the OpenID Connect
   specification [OpenID] is sufficient to convey this information.

   The identity assurance for user Claims, i.e. the binding of a certain
   Claim value to the person controlling the respective user account,
   typically varies among the different user Claims.  For example, the
   assurance an OP typically will be able to attest for an e-mail
   address will be "self-asserted", "verified by opt-in", or "verified
   by the respective e-mail provider via an attribute exchange
   protocol".  The family name of a user, in contrast, might have been
   verified in accordance with the respective Anti Money Laundering Law
   by showing an ID Card to a trained employee of the OP operator.

   Identity assurance therefore requires a way to convey assurance data
   along with and coupled to the respective user Claims.  This
   specification proposes a suitable representation and mechanisms the
   RP will utilize to request verified person data and accompanying
   identity assurance data.

1.1.  Terminology

   This section defines some terms relevant to the topic covered in this
   documents, heavily inspired by NIST SP 800-63A [NIST-SP-800-63a].

   o  Identity Proofing - process in which a user provides evidence to
      an OP reliably identifying themselves, thereby allowing the OP to
      assert that identification at a useful identity assurance level.

Internet-Draft     openid-connect-4-identity-assurance          May 2019


   o  Identify Verification - process conducted by the OP to verify the
      user's identity.

   o  Identity Assurance - process in which the OP attests identity data
      of a certain user with a certain assurance towards a RP, typically
      expressed by way of an assurance level.  Depending on legal
      requirements, the OP may also be required to provide evidences of
      the identity proofing process to the RP.

   o  Verified Person Data - Claims about a person whose binding to a
      particular use account were verified in the course of an identity
      verification process.

2.  Scope and Requirements

   The extension specified in this document SHALL

   o  allow an OpenID Connect RP to request identity data and to express
      requirements regarding this data and the evidences and processes
      employed,

   o  allow an OP to attest identity data obtained and maintained in
      accordance with a certain law, and

   o  allow the RP to map the data obtained from the OP to other laws,
      e.g. it shall be possible to use identity data maintained in
      accordance with the Anti Money Laundering Law to fulfill
      requirements defined by eIDAS.

   The scope of the extension is to define mechanisms to assert verified
   person data.

   It SHALL be possible to use existing OpenID Connect claims and other
   extensions defined beside this extension within the same OpenID
   Connect transaction and especially to render the same ID Token or
   other representations utilized to convey user claims.  For example,
   OpenID Connect already defines additional claims to inform the RP of
   the verification status of the "phone_number" and "email" claims.
   For the same reason, this extension SHALL allow the OP to attest
   verified and unverified claims in the same transaction.

   Where necessary, this extension will introduce new user claims to
   cover user attributes not currently covered by OpenID Connect, one
   example is the "place_of_birth".

   The representation defined in this specification is intended to be
   used to provide RPs with verified person data via any appropriate
   channel.  In the context of OpenID Connnect, verified person data can



Lodderstedt & Fett      Expires November 11, 2019               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     openid-connect-4-identity-assurance          May 2019


   be attested in ID Tokens or as part of the User Info response.  It is
   also possible to utilize the format described here in OAuth Token
   Introspection responses (see [RFC7662] and
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-jwt-introspection-response]) to provide resource
   servers with verified person data.

   This extension defines a way to assert verified claims only.  There
   is no need to cover unverified claims, or rather Claims without
   further information about the assurance, since they are already
   covered by OpenID Connect Core [OpenID].

   Even for asserting verified claims, this extension shall attempt to
   utilize existing OpenID Connect claims if possible and reasonable.
   It MUST, however, ensure developers cannot interpret non-verified
   claims as verified claims.

   The representation defined in this extension SHALL allow RPs to
   obtain assertions about verified claims from different OPs using
   different trust frameworks.

   This extension SHALL be usable by OPs operating under a regulation,
   such as eIDAS, as well as other OPs.  The former, called "notified
   eID system" in eIDAS, can attest identity data without the need to
   provide further evidences since they are operating under a well-
   defined regulation with clearly defined liability.  For example in
   case of eIDAS, the respective member state takes the liability for
   the identities asserted by its notified eID system.  The latter do
   not operate under such well-defined conditions, which typically
   requires the RP to obtain more data about the identity verification
   process and assess its applicability in its own legal context.

   From a technical perspective, this means this specification needs to
   support cases, where basically verified person data are provided
   along with the information about the regulatory framework (trust
   framework) the OP complies with and the respective level of
   assurance, whereas there shall also be support to externalize
   information about the identity verification process with the OP to
   the RP.

   Note: data transfer between OP and RP requires a legal basis that
   MUST be established upfront or in the course of the OpenID process.

3.  Claims

3.1.  User Claims

   In order to fulfill the requirements of some jurisdictions on
   identity assurance, this specification defines the following claims
   for conveying user data in addition to the claims defined in the
   OpenID Connect specification [OpenID]:

   o  "place_of_birth": a structured claim representing the end-user's
      place of birth.  It consists of the following fields:

      *  "country": ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2, e.g.  DE, or ISO 3166-3

      *  "region": State, province, prefecture, or region component

      *  "locality": city or other locality

   o  "nationality": represents the user's nationality in format ISO
      3166-1 Alpha-2, e.g.  DE

   o  "birth_name": family name someone has when he or she is born, or
      at least from the time he or she is a child.  This term can be
      used by a man or a woman who changes a name later in life for any
      reason.

   o  "salutation": end-user's salutation, e.g.  "Mr."

   o  "title": end-user's title, e.g.  "Dr."

3.2.  transaction_id

   Strong identity verification typically requires the participants to
   keep an audit trail of the whole process.

   This specification supports building an audit trail across the
   boundaries between OP and RP by introducing the claim
   "transaction_id".

   The "transaction_id" claim is a string value which

   o  MUST be unique within the context of the respective OP,

   o  MUST uniquely identify a certain transaction at the OP, and

   o  MUST allow an RP to obtain further transaction details if needed.

   If the OP issues a transaction_id, it MUST maintain a corresponding
   audit trail, which at least consists of the following details:




Lodderstedt & Fett      Expires November 11, 2019               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     openid-connect-4-identity-assurance          May 2019


   o  the transaction id,

   o  the authentication methods employed, and

   o  the transaction type (e.g. scope values).

   The OP MUST store the transaction data as long as it is required to
   store transaction data for auditing purposes by respective
   regulations.

   The RP requests this claim like any other claim via the claims
   parameter or as part of a default claim set identified by a scope
   value.

4.  Verified Data Representation

   This extension to OpenID Connect wants to ensure that RPs cannot
   mixup verified and unverified claims and incidentally process
   unverified claims as verified claims.

   The representation proposed therefore provides the RP with the
   verified claims within a structured claim "verified_person_data".
   This structured claim is composed of the verification evidences
   related to a certain verification process and the corresponding user
   claims which were verified in this process.

   This section explains the structure and meaning of the claim in
   detail, the syntax is also given as JSON schema in section JSON
   Schema [1].

   The "verified_person_data" claim consists of the following sub-
   elements:

   o  "verification": REQUIRED.  Object that contains all data about the
      verification process.

   o  "claims": REQUIRED.  Object that is the container for the verified
      user claims.

4.1.  verification Element

   This element contains the information about the process conducted to
   verify a person's identity and bind the respective person data to a
   user account.

   The "verification" element consists of the following elements:





Lodderstedt & Fett      Expires November 11, 2019               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     openid-connect-4-identity-assurance          May 2019


   "trust_framework": REQUIRED.  String determing the trust framework
   governing the identity verification process and the identity
   assurance level of the OP.

   An example value is "eidas_ial_high", which denotes a notified eID
   system under eIDAS providing identity assurance at level of assurance
   "High".

   Standardized values are defined in Trust Frameworks [2].

   The "trust_framework" value determines what further data is provided
   to the RP in the "verification" element.  A notified eID system under
   eIDAS, for example, would not need to provide any further data
   whereas an OP not governed by eIDAS would need to provide
   verification evidences in order to allow the RP to fulfill its legal
   obligations.  An example of the latter is an OP acting under the
   German Anti-Money laundering law ("de_aml").

   "date": Time stamp in ISO 8601:2004 YYYY-MM-DD format representing
   the date when identity verification took place.  Presence of this
   element might be required for certain trust frameworks.

   "id": Unique reference to the identity verification process as
   performed by the OP.  Used for backtracing in case of disputes or
   audits.  Note: In contrast to this field, the claim "transaction_id"
   refers to the transaction leading the OP to attest the user's
   verified identity data towards a RP.  Presence of this element might
   be required for certain trust frameworks.

   "evidences" is a JSON array containing the evidences the IDP used to
   verifiy the user's identity as separate JSON objects.  Every object
   contains the property "type" determining it's respective type.  The
   RP uses this information to process the "evidence" property
   appropriately.

4.1.1.  Evidences

   The following types of evidences are defined:

   o  "id_document": verification based on any kind of government issued
      identity document

   o  "utility_bill": verification based on an utility bill

   o  "qes": verification based on a eIDAS Qualified Electronic
      Signature

4.1.1.1.  id_document

   The following elements are contained in an "id_document" evidence
   sub-element.

   "method": REQUIRED.  The method used to verify the id document,
   predefined values are given in Verification Methods [3]

   "verifier": OPTIONAL.  A JSON object denoting the legal entity that
   performed the identity verification on behalf of the OP.  This object
   SHOULD only be included if the IDP did not perform the identity
   verification itself.  This object consists of the following
   properties:

   o  "organization": String denoting the organization which performed
      the verification on behalf of the OP.

   o  "agent": Agent (person) who conducted the verification.  The agent
      may be identified by Name or an identifier which can be resolved
      into the agent's name during an audit.

   "document": A JSON object representing the id document used to
   perform the id verification.  It consists of the following
   properties:

   o  "type": REQUIRED.  String denoting the type of the id document,
      standardized values are defined in Identity Documents [4].  The OP
      MAY use other than the predefined values in which case the RPs
      will either be unable to process the assertion, just store this
      value for audit purposes, or apply bespoken business logic to it.

   o  "number": String representing the number of the identity document.

   o  "issuer": A JSON object containg information about the government
      agency that issued this identity document.  This object consists
      of the following properties:

      *  "name": REQUIRED.  Designation of the issuer of the identity
         document

      *  "country": String denoting the country where the document was
         issued, format: ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2, e.g.  "DE".

   o  "date_of_issuance": CONDITIONALLY REQUIRED.  The date the document
      was issued as ISO 8601:2004 YYYY-MM-DD format, if this attribute
      exists for the particular type of document.

   properties:

   o  "name": A String designating the provider.

   o  All elements of the OpenID Connect "address" Claim ([OpenID])

   "date": A ISO 8601:2004 YYYY-MM-DD formated string containing the
   date when this bill was issued.

4.1.1.3.  qes

   the process and according to the policies determined by the
   corresponding "verification" element.

   The "claims" element MAY contain one or more of the following user
   claims as defined in Section 5.1 of the OpenID Connect specification
   [OpenID]

   o  "name"

   o  "given_name"

   o  "middle_name"

   o  "family_name"

   o  "birthdate"

   o  "address"

   or of the following claims as defined in Section User Claims [5]:

   o  "place_of_birth"

   o  "nationality"

   o  "birth_name"

   The "claims" element MAY also contain other claims given the value of
   the respective claim was verified in the verification process
   represented by the sibling "verification" element.

5.  Requesting Verified Person Data

5.1.  Requesting User Claims

   Verified person data can be requested on the level of individual user
   claims by utilzing the "claims" parameter as defined in Section 5.5.
   of the OpenID Connect specification [OpenID].

   Bassically, the claim "verified_person_data" is added to the section
   "userinfo" or "id_token" of the "claims" parameter.

   Since "verified_person_data" contains the effective user claims in a
   nested "claims" element, the syntax is extended to include
   expressions on nested elements as follows.  The
   "verified_person_data" element includes a "claims" element, which in
   turn includes the desired user claims as keys with a "null" value.
   An example is shown in the following:

   {
      "userinfo":{
         "verified_person_data":{
            "claims":{
               "given_name":null,
               "family_name":null,
               "birthdate":null
            }
         }
      }
   }

Internet-Draft     openid-connect-4-identity-assurance          May 2019


   Use of the "claims" parameter allows the RP to exactly select the
   user claims needed for its use case.  This extension therefore allows
   RPs to fulfill the requirement for data minimization.

   RPs MAY indicate that a certain claim is essential to the sucessful
   completion of the user journey by utilizing the "essential" field as
   defined in Section 5.5.1. of the OpenID Connect specification
   [OpenID].  The following example designates both given as well as
   family name as being essential.

   {
      "userinfo":{
         "verified_person_data":{
            "claims":{
               "given_name":{"essential": true},
               "family_name":{"essential": true},
               "birthdate":null
            }
         }
      }
   }

   Note: A "claims" sub-element with value "null" is interpreted as a
   request for all possible claims.  An example is shown in the
   following:

   {
      "userinfo":{
         "verified_person_data":{
            "claims":null
         }
      }
   }

   Note: The "claims" sub-element can be omitted, which is equivalent to
   a claims element whose value is "null".

   Note: If the "claims" sub-element is empty or contains a claim not
   fulfilling the requirements defined in Section claims [6], the OP
   will abort the transaction with an "invalid_request" error.

5.2.  Defining constraints on requested data

   The RP MAY express requirements regarding the elements in the
   verification sub-element.

   This, again, requires an extension to the syntax as defined in
   Section 5.5. of the OpenID Connect specification [OpenID] due to the
   nested nature of the "verified_person_data" claim.

   Section 5.5.1 of the OpenID Connect specification [OpenID] defines a
   query syntax that allows for the member value of the claim being
   requested to be a JSON object with additional information/constraints
   on the claim.  For doing so it defines three members ("essential",
   "value" and "values") with special query meanings and allows for
   other special members to be defined (while stating that any members
   that are not understood must be ignored).

   This specification re-uses this mechanics and introduces a new such
   member "max_age" (see below).

   To start with, the RP may limit the possible values of the elements
   "trust_framework", "evidences/id_document/document/type", and
   "identity_document/method" by utilizing the "value" or "values"
   fields.

   The following example shows that the RP wants to obtain an
   attestation based on AML and limited to users who were identified in
   a bank branch using government issued id documents.

   {
      "userinfo":{
         "verified_person_data":{
            "verification":{
               "trust_framework":{
                  "value":"de_aml"
               },
               "id_document":{
                  "document":{
                     "type":{
                        "values":[
                           "idcard",
                           "passport"
                        ]
                     }
                  },
                  "method":{
                     "value":"pipp"
                  }
               }
            },
            "claims":null
         }
      }
   }

   The RP may also express a requirement regarding the age of the
   verification data, i.e., the time elapsed since the verification
   process asserted in the "verification" element has taken place.

   This specification therefore defines a new member "max_age".

   "max_age": OPTIONAL.  Is a JSON number value only applicable to
   claims that contain dates or timestamps.  It defines the maximum time
   (in seconds) to be allowed to elapse since the value of the date/
   timestamp up to the point in time of the request.  The IDP should
   make the calculation of elapsed time starting from the last valid
   second of the date value.  The following is an example of a request
   for claims where the verification process of the data is not allowed
   to be older than 63113852 seconds.

   The following is an example:

   {
      "userinfo":{
         "verified_person_data":{
            "verification":{
               "date":{
                  "max_age":"63113852"
               }
            },
            "claims":null
         }
      }
   }

   The OP SHOULD try to fulfill this requirement.  If the verification
   data of the user is older than the requested "max_age", the OP MAY
   attempt to refresh the user's verification by sending her through a
   online identity verification process, e.g. by utilizing an electronic
   ID card or a video identification approach.

   If the OP is unable to fulfill the requirement (even in case it is
   marked as being "essential"), it will provide the RP with the data
   available and the RP may decide how to use the data.  The OP MUST NOT
   return an error in case it cannot return all claims requested as
   essential claims.

6.  Examples

   The following sections show examples of "verified_person_data"
   objects.

   The first and second section show JSON snippets of the general
   identity assurance case, where the RP is provided with verification
   evidences for different verification methods along with the actual
   user claims.

   The third section illustrate how the contents of this object could
   look like in case of a notified eID system under eIDAS, where the OP
   does not need to provide evidences of the identity verification
   process to the RP.

   Subsequent sections contain examples for using the
   "verified_person_data" claim on different channels and in combination
   with other (non-verified) user claims.

   "verified_person_data_supported": Boolean value indicating support
   for the "verified_person_data", i.e. the OpenID Connect for Identity
   Assurance extension.

   "trust_frameworks_supported" This is a JSON array containing all
   supported trust frameworks.

   "evidences_supported" This JSON array contains all types of identity
   evidences the OP uses.

   "id_documents_supported" This JSON array contains all identity
   documents utilized by the OP for identity verification.

   "id_documents_verification_methods_supported" This element is a JSON
   array containing the id document verification methods a OP supports
   as defined in Section verification [7].

   "verified_person_data_supported" This JSON array contains all claims
   supported within "verified_person_data".

   This is an example openid-configuration snippet:

         "nationality",
         "address"
      ],
   ...
   }

   The OP MUST support the claims parameter and needs to publish this in
   its openid-configuration using the claim
   "claims_parameter_supported".

8.  Transaction-specific Purpose

   This specification introduces the request parameter "purpose" to
   allow a RP to state the purpose for the transfer of user data it is
   asking for.

   "purpose" OPTIONAL.  String describing the purpose for obtaining
   certain user data from the OP.  The purpose MUST NOT be shorter than
   3 characters and MUST NOT be longer than 300 characters.  If these
   rules are violated, the authentication request MUST fail and the OP
   returns an error "invalid_request" to the RP.

   The OP MUST display this purpose in the respective user consent
   screen(s) in order to inform the user about the designated use of the
   data to be transferred or the authorization to be approved.

   If the parameter "purpose" is not present in the request, the OP MAY
   utilize a description that was pre-configured for the respective RP.

   Note: In order to prevent injection attacks, the IDP MUST escape the
   text appropriately before it will be shown in a user interface.  The
   IDP MUST expect special characters in the URL decoded purpose text
   provided by the RP.  The IDP MUST ensure that any special characters
   in the purpose text cannot be used to inject code into the web
   interface of the OP (e.g. cross-site scripting, defacing).  Proper
   escaping MUST be applied by the OP.  The OP SHALL NOT remove
   characters from the purpose text to this end.
