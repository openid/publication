                OpenID Service Key Discovery 1.0 - Draft   December 2006


1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   Identifier: An Identifier is a URL or XRI [1].
   Service Endpoint: A web application described in an XRDS document.
   Public Key: A document containing the public material of a key pair
      used in asymmetric cryptography e.g., a PEM formatted RSA public
      key or an X.509 certificate.


3.  Introduction

   It is common for two Service Endpoints to wish to communicate
   securely.  Public key cryptography is one mechanism for securing a
   channel between two Service Endpoints without requiring a previously
   established shared secret.  This document describes a standard way
   for Service Endpoints to advertise and discover Public Keys.


4.  XML Namespaces

   The default namespace in this document for XML fragments without a
   namespace prefix is xmlns="http://openid.net/keydisc/1.0".  Other
   namespace prefixes used include xmlns:xrd="xri://$xrd*($v*2.0)".


5.  Public Key Advertising

   Public Keys are advertised by adding a "<PublicKey>" element to an
   endpoints "<xrd:Service>" element.  The new element.  The
   "<PublicKey>" element contains a single child text node that contains
   the URL where the Public Key can be retrieved.

   Here is an example XRDS service element,

     <xrd:Service priority="0">
       <xrd:Type
         >http://www.example.com/secure_messaging/1.0
       </xrd:Type>
       <xrd:URI>
         http://www.example.com/server
       </xrd:URI>
       <PublicKey>
         https://www.example.com/X509.crt
       </PublicKey>
     </xrd:Service>


6.  Public Key Discovery

   The Public Key for a Service Endpoint is discovered by performing
   XRDS resolution on the Endpoint's Identifier.  Once the the
   Identifier is resolved to and XRDS, the Service element is looked up
   by Type, and the URL of the Public Key can be parsed out of the
   "<PublicKey>" element.

   The Public Key is then retrieved by making an HTTP [RFC2616] GET
   request for the parsed URL which SHOULD be over TLS [RFC2818].  The
   type of key material is application dependant, and can be identified
   by the Content-Type header when retrieving the key.

6.1.  Security Considerations

   There are two ways that Public Key discovery can be secure.  The
   first way requires that every URL requested has a scheme of "https"
   and SSL certificates are verified during each request.  The second
   way requires that the Public Key is a certificate containing the
   Identifier used to initiate discovery and is signed by a trusted
   third party.

   If these requirements are not met, clients discovering Public Keys
   may be vulnerable to attack.  The types of vulnerabilities include
   DNS cache poisoning and man in the middle attacks.
