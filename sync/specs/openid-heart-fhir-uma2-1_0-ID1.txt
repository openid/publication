 Health Relationship Trust Profile for Fast Healthcare Interoperability
                    Resources (FHIR) UMA 2 Resources
                       openid-heart-fhir-uma-2_0

Abstract

   FHIR is an HTTP-based, resource-oriented RESTful API based on a set
   of clinical, administrative, financial, and infrastructure resource
   definitions.  The API supports create, read, update, delete, and
   search operations, as well as a framework for ad-hoc operations.

   The User-Managed Access (UMA) 2.0 protocol framework defines a
   mechanism to allow a resource owner to delegate access to a protected
   resource for a client application used by a requesting party
   (identified by a set of claims), optionally limited by a set of
   scopes.

   This specification profiles the resource types and claim types to be
   used with the FHIR protocol to increase baseline security, provide
   greater interoperability, and structure deployments in a manner
   specifically applicable to (but not limited to) the healthcare
   domain.

1.  Introduction

   This document profiles the UMA 2 authorization framework for use in
   the context of securing Representational State Transfer (RESTful)
   interfaces using the Fast Health Interoperable Resources (FHIR)
   protocol.  The FHIR UMA 2.0 profile defined in this document serve to
   define a baseline set of UMA resource types, scopes, and claims
   suitable for a wide range of use cases, while maintaining reasonable
   ease of implementation and functionality.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   All uses of JSON Web Signature (JWS) [RFC7517] and JSON Web
   Encryption (JWE) [RFC7518] data structures in this specification
   utilize the JWS Compact Serialization or the JWE Compact

   Serialization; the JWS JSON Serialization and the JWE JSON
   Serialization are not used.

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Authorization
   Code", "Authorization Endpoint", "Authorization Grant",
   "Authorization Server", "Client", "Client Authentication", "Client
   Identifier", "Client Secret", "Grant Type", "Protected Resource",
   "Redirection URI", "Refresh Token", "Resource Owner", "Resource
   Server", "Response Type", and "Token Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749], the terms "Claim Name", "Claim Value", and "JSON Web Token
   (JWT)" defined by JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519], and the terms
   defined by OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core].

2.  Resource Registration

   Resource sets MUST be registered by the resource server at the
   authorization server before they can be accessed by clients.

   Resources MUST be structured in such a way that an unauthorized
   request to the resource (with no access token) can be unambiguously
   mapped to an authorization server.

2.1.  Resource Types

   Resource sets MUST include a "type" identifier describing the kind of
   FHIR resources being protected, based on the FHIR compartment or
   resource that fits the data being protected.

   For compartments, this value SHALL be a URL of the form
   "http://www.hl7.org/fhir/
   compartmentdefinition-<compartmentname>.html", where
   "<compartmentname>" is the FHIR compartment type designation as found
   on "http://www.hl7.org/fhir/compartmentdefinition.html".

   For resources, this value SHALL be a URL in the form
   "http://www.hl7.org/fhir/<resourcename>.html", where "<resourcename>"
   is the FHIR resource type designation as found on
   "http://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html".

2.2.  Scopes

   Resource sets MUST specify at least one resource access scope as
   defined in section 2 of [HEART.OAuth2.FHIR].

   Additionally, the resource MAY use any of the scopes defined in
   [HEART.OAuth2.FHIR] section 3 regarding confidentiality and
   sensitivity, or in section 4 regarding emergency (break the glass).

3.  Claims Presentation

   For determining access to healthcare records, it's useful to define a
   standard set of claims that can be used across domains to represent
   common access conditions.  The following claims are defined as
   additional claims to be included in a user's OpenID Connect ID token
   or UserInfo Endpoint response.

   The claims used for processing MUST be considered in the context of
   the issuer of these claims.  The method by which an authorization
   server determines which issuers are allowed to make which claims is
   out of scope of this specification.

3.1.  Membership in an organization

   To include all members of an organization, such as a hospital,
   include the "org" claim.

   org  Array of machine-readable URIs representing organizations that
      the user is a part of.

   If the value of "org" is the same as the "iss" of the ID token, it
   SHOULD be taken as authoritative in determining membership.

3.2.  Professional credentialing status

   To reference licenses, accreditations, or other professional
   credentials held by the current user, include the "pro" claim.  These
   are generally for things such as specific medical licenses or
   degrees.

   pro  Array of machine-readable values representing the professional
      credential held by the current user.

   Each "pro" value consists of a JSON object with the following
   members:

   src  URI representing the authority conveying the professional
      credential on the user, such as a state or regulatory group

   val  String value representing the nature of the processional
      credential held.

                             HEART FHIR UMA2                   July 2018


   The value of the professional credential is dependent on and
   potentially defined in the context of the authoritative source.  An
   example list of professional values can be found at
   "http://www.hl7.org/fhir/v2/0360/2.7/index.html".

   The means by which a given organization is trusted to convey a given
   professional status to an organization is outside the scope of this
   document.  Note that the "src" claim here is likely to be different
   from the "iss" of the ID token, and the means by which an issuer is
   trusted to assert holding of accreditation from a particular source
   is outside the scope of this specification.

3.3.  Specific identification of parties

   To reference an individual, an authorization server MAY use the email
   claim.

   To determine which server is authoritative for a given email domain
   at runtime, an authorization server MAY take the target email address
   and perform a webfinger [RFC7033] lookup of the OpenID Connect
   issuer.  The discovered issuer SHOULD be considered canonical for
   email addresses from that domain.

3.4.  Emergency access

   Those with a need for emergency access can be flagged with the "er"
   claim.

   er Boolean indicating, if present and true, that the current user has
      emergency responder status and SHOULD be given access to records
      for emergency use without requiring the input of the resource
      owner by the way of a "break the glass" emergency access policy
      (see Section 4.1)

4.  Policy Development

   While a wide range of policies and policy engines are available to
   implementors, there are some general recommendations regarding the
   use of such policies with medical records.

   An authorization server SHOULD provision a newly registered resource
   set with a default-deny policy, such that sharing is allowed only
   when the resource owner explicitly shares it.

   Authorization servers MUST provide resource owners with the means to
   set policies based on any of the claims in this document referencing
   any of the scopes allowed in Section 2.2.

                             HEART FHIR UMA2                   July 2018


   Authorization servers MUST provide a means for resource owners to
   audit which policies are in effect at any protected resources
   controlled by the resource owner.

4.1.  "Break the glass" emergency access policies

   Authorization servers SHOULD provide a mechanism to specify a policy
   to accept certain flags, including but not limited to the "er" claim
   provided by trusted identity providers, to gain access to the
   resource set without direct involvement by the resource owner.  This
   type of policy MUST include access to the "btg" scope specified in
   the HEART OAuth FHIR profile [HEART.OAuth2.FHIR].

5.  Security considerations

   All claims presented to an authorization server need to be taken in
   the context of the presenter and issuer of the claim, and therefore
   trusted only in so much as the issuer is trusted to assert such
   claims.  For example, an end user run identity provider should not be
   considered the canonical source for medical license information,
   unless the authorization server accepting the assertions has an
   external relationship with that identity provider that provides such
   trust.

6.  Privacy considerations

   Since the initial request for a resource is made in an unauthorized
   and unauthenticated context, such requests are by definition open to
   all users.  The response of that request includes a pointer to the
   authorization server to query for an access token and present claims.
   If it is known out of band that authorization server is owned and
   controlled by a single user, or visiting the authorization server
   contains other identifying information, then an unauthenticated and
   unauthorized client would be able to tell which resource owner is
   associated with a given resource.  In the FHIR API, this means that a
   client would be able to discern which patient a given record is for
   without being authorized for that information and without the
   resource server giving that information explicitly.  Other
   information about the resource owner, such as organizational
   affiliation or group membership, may be gained from this transaction
   as well.

Appendix C.  Purpose of Use

   The ability to specify information be made available for a specific
   purpose of use is key to many different medical information use
   cases.  For example, a patient might determine that some things are
   available for research, while others are only available for
   treatment.  At this time, these specifications do not define methods
   for indicating purpose of use beyond the "emergency access" claim
   defined in Section 3.4 and the "break the glass" mechanism defined in
   Section 4.1.  The working group anticipates that expansion of this
   mechanism in implementations, which could lead to expansions of this
   protocol going forward.
