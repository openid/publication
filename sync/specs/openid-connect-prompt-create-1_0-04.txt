       Initiating User Registration via OpenID Connect - draft 04
                    openid-connect-prompt-create-1_0

Abstract

   An extension to the OpenID Connect Authentication Framework defining
   a new value for the "prompt" parameter that instructs the OpenID
   Provider to start the user flow with user registration and after the
   user account has been created return an authorization code to the
   client to complete the authentication flow.

1.  Introduction

   Several years of deployment and implementation experience with OpenID
   Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core] has uncovered a need, in some
   circumstances, for the client to explicitly signal to the OpenID
   Provider that the user desires to create a new account rather than
   authenticate an existing identity.

   This allows the client to indicate to the OpenID Provider that the
   user desires to create an account.  This improves the user experience
   because the user doesn't have to first see the login form and then
   find the sign-up link on the form and select it before getting to the
   user's desired action.

   This specification defines a new value for the "prompt" parameter.

2.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   In the .txt version of this specification, values are quoted to
   indicate that they are to be taken literally.  When using these
   values in protocol messages, the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of
   the value.  In the HTML version of this specification, values to be
   taken literally are indicated by the use of "this fixed-width font".

3.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "authorization endpoint",
   "authorization request", "authorization response", and "client"
   defined by The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC6749].

4.  Prompt Parameter

   In requests to the OpenID Provider, a client MAY indicate that the
   desired user experience is for the user to immediately see the user
   account creation UI instead of the login behavior.

   prompt
      A value of "create" indicates to the OpenID Provider that the
      client desires that the user be shown the account creation UX
      rather than the login flow.  Care must be taken if combining this
      value with other "prompt" values.  Mutually exclusive conditions
      can arise so it is RECOMMENDED that "create" not be combined with
      any other values.

4.1.  Authorization Request

   When the "prompt" parameter is used in an authorization request to
   the authorization endpoint with the value of "create", it indicates
   that the user has chosen to be shown the account creation experience
   rather than the login experience.  Whether the AS creates a brand new
   identity or helps the user authenticate an identity they already have
   is out of scope for this specification.  The behavior is the same for
   all response types.

   For authorization requests sent as a JWTs, such as when using
   Section 6 of OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core], the "prompt"
   claim value MUST be a space delimited set of prompt values in keeping
   with Section 3.1.2.1 of OpenID Connect Core 1.0.

   If the OpenID Provider receives a prompt value that it does not
   support (not declared in the "prompt_values_supported" metadata
   field) the OP SHOULD respond with an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status
   code and an error value of "invalid_request".  It is RECOMMENDED that
   the OP return an error_description value identifying the invalid
   parameter value.

   In Figure 1 is an example of an authorization request using the
   "code" response type where the client tells the OpenID Provider that
   it wants the user to start from the account creation user experience
   (extra line breaks and indentation are for display purposes only).

     GET /as/authorization.oauth2?response_type=code
        &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
        &state=tNwzQ87pC6llebpmac_IDeeq-mCR2wLDYljHUZUAWuI
        &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Eorg%2Fcb
        &scope=openid%20profile
        &prompt=create HTTP/1.1
     Host: authorization-server.example.com

                 Figure 1: Code Flow Authorization Request

4.2.  Discovery Metadata

   This specification extends the OpenID Connect Discovery Metadata
   Section 3 [OpenID.Discovery] and defines the following:

   prompt_values_supported
      OPTIONAL.  JSON array containing the list of prompt values that
      this OP supports.

   This metadata element is OPTIONAL in the context of the OpenID
   Provider not supporting the "create" value.  If omitted, the Relying
   Party should assume that this specification is not supported.  The
   OpenID Provider MAY provide this metadata element even if it doesn't
   support the "create" value.

   Specific to this specification, a value of "create" in the arrauy
   indicates to the Relying party that this OpenID Provider supports
   this specification.  If an OpenID Provider supports this
   specification it MUST define this metadata element in the openid-
   configuration file.  Additionally, if this metadata element is
   defined by the OpenID Provider, the OP must also specify all other
   prompt values which it supports.

   2019-10-02

   o  Incorporated feedback from the working group.  Add text around
