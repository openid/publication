      <t>
        An extension to the OpenID Connect Authentication Framework
        defining a new value for the <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx>
        parameter that instructs the OpenID Provider to start the user flow with
        user registration and after the user account has been created return an
        authorization code to the client to complete the authentication flow.
      </t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        Several years of deployment and implementation experience with <xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</xref>
        has uncovered a need, in some circumstances, for the client to explicitly signal to the OpenID Provider that the user
        desires to create a new account rather than authenticate an existing identity.
      </t>
      <t>
        This allows the client to indicate to the OpenID Provider that the user desires to create an account.
        This improves the user experience because the user doesn't have to first see the login form and then find
        the sign-up link on the form and select it before getting to the user's desired action.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification defines a new parameter value for the <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx> parameter.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="rnc" title="Requirements Notation and Conventions">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

        <t>
          In the .txt version of this specification,
          values are quoted to indicate that they are to be taken literally.
          When using these values in protocol messages,
          the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.
          In the HTML version of this specification,
          values to be taken literally are indicated by
          the use of <spanx style="verb">this fixed-width font</spanx>.
        </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Terminology" title="Terminology">
      <t>
        This specification uses the terms
        "authorization endpoint",
        "authorization request",
        "authorization response",
        and "client"
        defined by <xref target="RFC6749">The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework</xref>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="PromptParameter" title="Prompt Parameter">
      <t>
        In requests to the OpenID Provider, a client MAY indicate that the desired user experience is for the
        user to immediately see the user account creation UI instead of the login behavior.

      <list style="hanging">

      <t hangText="prompt">
        <vspace/>
        A value of <spanx style="verb">create</spanx> indicates to the OpenID Provider that
        the client desires that the user be shown the account creation UX rather than the
        login flow. Care must be taken if combining this value with other <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx> values.
        Mututally exclusive conditions can arise so it is RECOMMENDED that <spanx style="verb">create</spanx>
        not be present with any other values.
      </t>
      </list>

      </t>

      <section anchor="authz-req" title="Authorization Request">
      <t>
        When the <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx> parameter is used in an
        authorization request to the authorization endpoint with the value of
        <spanx style="verb">create</spanx>, it indicates that the user has
        chosen to be shown the account creation experience rather than the
        login experience. Whether the AS creates a brand new identity or helps
        the user authenticate an identity they already have is out of scope for
        this specification. The behavior is the same for both the implicit flow
        (Section 3.2 of <xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</xref>),
        and the authorization code flow (Section 3.1 of
        <xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</xref>).
      </t>
      <t>
        For authorization requests sent as a JWTs, such as when using
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-jwsreq">JWT Secured Authorization Request</xref>,
        the <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx> claim value MUST be a space delimited set
        of prompt values in keeping with Section 3.1.2.1 of <xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</xref>.
      </t>
      <t>
        How the OpenID Provider handles prompt values that it fails to parse is out of scope for this specification.

        -or-

        If the OpenID Provider fails to parse the provided value(s) it should ignore the
        <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx> parameter value and proceed as if the <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx> parameter
        was not specified.
      </t>
      <t>
        An example of an authorization request where the client tells the OpenID Provider that it wants the user to
        start from the account creation user experience is shown in <xref target="authz-endpoint-example-token"/> below
        (extra line breaks and indentation are for display purposes only).
