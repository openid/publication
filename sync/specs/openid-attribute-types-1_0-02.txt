1.  Overview

   OpenID ([OpenID.authentication-2.0]) identity attributes are pieces
   of identity data that may be transferred using the OpenID Attribute
   Exchange extension ([OpenID.attribute-exchange-1.0]).  They are
   uniquely identified by a URI, and have associated meta-data
   describing them.

   As attributes are continually being added, this document does not
   attempt to enumerate them.  Rather, the process for definition and
   creation of the attributes is listed.  Only attributes in the
   "schema.openid.net" name space are pertinent to this discussion;
   there are no restrictions on the definition and creation of
   attributes in other name spaces.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Definitions and Conventions

   Identity Attribute Type  Identity attribute types (also referred to
      as simply "attribute types") are types of subject properties
      expressed in an identity context.  Examples are "surname" or
      "birth date".

   Identity Attribute Format Type  The identity attribute format type
      ("format type") refers to the layout of the data in the value of
      an identity attribute type.  They may be as simple as a normalized
      string or as complicated as a telephone number format.

3.  Attribute Type Definition

   Attributes defined in the "schema.openid.net" name space are listed
   in the index document at <http://schema.openid.net/>.  Each attribute
   is also defined by resolving its attribute type identifier URI.  The
   format for the meta-data in the definition document is outlined in
   [identity-attribute-metadata-1.0].  The meta-data at
   "schema.openid.net" is recorded in XML but may be expressed in a
   human readable format using XSLT.

   The meta-data recorded includes the format of the type's value and a
   localized label and description.  Optional data including examples,
   cross references and acquisition and authority information may also
   be recorded.

3.1.  Attribute Format Types

   Base types for the format of the identity data values are also stored
   in the schema.openid.net name space.  The type index is located at
   <http://schema.openid.net/types/>.  Type data is expressed in XML
   Schema format as specified in [identity-attribute-metadata-1.0].

4.  Attribute Creation

4.1.  New Attribute Process

   New OpenID identity data attribute types may be proposed by any
   interested parties; this section outlines the process involved in
   doing so.  Note that this process only applies to identity types in
   the "schema.openid.net" name space.  Anyone is free to implement
   attribute types in other name spaces.

   1.  The first step in proposing a new identity attribute type is to
       search the list of existing types for similar attributes.
       Duplication of attribute types should be avoided.

   2.  Post an "intent to define" message to the mailing list at
       schema@openid.net.  The email should describe the proposed type
       in general terms.  Posting this to the list will reduce
       duplicated effort in the case of multiple parties defining
       similar types.  Intent posts will also generate discussion that
       may be used to determine if it is worthwhile to pursue the
       proposal.

   3.  The attribute type should be completely described both in regular
       prose and in the meta-data format defined in
       [identity-attribute-metadata-1.0].  Tools to help create and
       validate the meta-data will likely evolve.

   4.  Post a "proposed attribute" message to the mailing list at
       "schema@openid.net", including the attribute type identifier,
       motivation, description and meta-data.  An administrator will
       post the attribute type meta-data to the experimental
       "http://openid.net/x/" area.

   5.  Discussions on the list will dictate whether or not the proposal
       passes.  If the consensus is that the proposed attribute type is
       worth pursuing, the type will be moved into the non-experimental
       name space and the "schema@openid.net" list notified.

   The approval stage of the process is deliberately vague; the idea
   being that a more detailed process will emerge as more interested
   parties take part.  In any case, approval should be the default
   action if there is no vocal disapproval and the proposed type is not
   a duplicate of an existing type.

4.2.  New Attribute Data Format Process

   New attribute data format types are proposed and approved in a
   similar manner to attribute types themselves.  The proposed type is

   sent to the list expressed in XML Schema
   ([W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028]) format as outlined in
   [identity-attribute-metadata-1.0].  Often format type proposals will
   accompany an attribute type proposal; in this case it is acceptable
   to combine the two proposals.

   1.  The first step in proposing a new attribute format type is to
       search the list of existing types for similar types.  Duplication
       of format types should be avoided.

   2.  Post an "intent to define" message to the mailing list at
       schema@openid.net.  The email should describe the proposed type
       in general terms.  Posting this to the list will reduce
       duplicated effort in the case of multiple parties defining
       similar types.  Intent posts will also generate discussion that
       may be used to determine if it is worthwhile to pursue the
       proposal.

   3.  The format type should be completely described both in regular
       prose and in the meta-data format defined in
       [identity-attribute-metadata-1.0].

   4.  Post a "proposed format type" message to the mailing list at
       "schema@openid.net", including the motivation, description and
       meta-data.  An administrator will post the attribute type meta-
       data to the experimental "http://openid.net/type/x/" area.

   5.  Discussions on the list will dictate whether or not the proposal
       passes.  If the consensus is that the proposed format type is
       worth pursuing, the type will be moved into the non-experimental
       name space and the "schema@openid.net" list notified.

4.3.  Attribute Type Identifiers

   Attribute type identifiers should be created with the following
   considerations:

   o  Attribute type identifiers MUST conform to the generic URI syntax
      described in [RFC2396].

   o  The OpenID authority portion of the URI is "schema.openid.net".

   o  Each URI resolves to an RDF representation of the type's meta-data
      as defined in [identity-attribute-metadata-1.0].

   o  URIs should, where possible, re-use existing paths in the
      schema.openid.net namespace.

   o  The URI path should be kept as short as possible.

   o  URI fragment specifiers should not be used.
