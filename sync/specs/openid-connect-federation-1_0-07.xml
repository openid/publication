    <abstract>
      <t>The OpenID Connect standard specifies how an Relying Party (RP)
        can discover metadata about an OpenID Provider (OP), and then
        register to obtain RP credentials. The discovery and
        registration process does not involve any mechanisms of
        dynamically establishing trust in the exchanged information, but
        instead rely on out-of-band trust establishment.
      </t>

      <t>In an identity federation context, this is not sufficient. The
        participants of the federation must be able to trust information
        provided about other participants in the federation. OpenID
        Connect Federations specifies how trust can be dynamically
        obtained by resolving trust from a common trusted third party.
      </t>

      <t>While this specification is primarily targeting OpenID Connect,
        it is designed to allow for re-use by other
        protocols and in other use cases.

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>This specification describes how two entities that would like to
        interact can dynamically fetch and resolve trust and metadata for a
        given protocol through the use of third party trust issuers. A trust
        issuer is an entity whose main purpose is to issue statements
        about entities, such as OpenID relying party and providers. An identity
        federation can be realized using this specification by the use of one or
        more levels of trust issuers. This specification does not mandate a
        specific way or restrict how a federation may be built. Instead, the
        specification provides the basic technical trust infrastructure building
        blocks needed to build a dynamic and distributed trust network such as a
        federation.
      </t>

      <t>All entities in an OpenID Connect federation MUST have a globally
        unique identifier.
      </t>

      <t>Note that a company, as with any real-world organization, may be
        represented by more than one entity in a federation.
      </t>

      <t>OpenID Connect Federation trust chains rely on
        cryptographically signed JWT documents, and the trust chain does not at
        all rely on TLS in order to establish trust.

      <section title="Trust chain" anchor="trust_chain">
        <t>
          In an OIDC Identity Federation, entities that together build a
          trust chain can be categorized as:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Trust anchor">An entity that represents a trusted
              third party
            </t>
            <t hangText="Leaf">In an OIDC Identity federation an RP or an OP
            </t>
            <t hangText="Intermediate">Neither a leaf nor a trust anchor</t>
          </list>
          A trust chain begins with a leaf entity's self-signed entity
          statement, has zero or more entity statements
          issued by intermediates about subordinates, and ends with an
          entity statement issued by the trust anchor about the top-most
          intermediate (if there are intermediates) or the leaf entity
          (if there are no intermediates)
          and finally a self-signed entity statement about the trust anchor.
        </t>
        <t>A simple example: If we have an RP that belongs to organisation A
          who is a member of federation F, the trust chain for such a setup
          will contain the following entity statements:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
              A self-signed entity statement about the RP published by the RP
            </t>
            <t>
              An entity statement about the RP published by Organisation A
            </t>
            <t>
              An entity statement about Organisation A published by Federation
              F
            </t>
            <t>
              A self-signed entity statement about Federation F published
              by Federation F.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          A trust chain MUST always be possible to order such that:
          If we name the entity statements ES[0] (the leaf entity's
          self-signed entity statement) to ES[i] (the trust anchors
          self-signed entity statement), i>0 then:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              The *iss* entity in one entity statement is always the *sub*
              entity in the next.
              ES[j]['iss'] == ES[j+1]['sub'], j=0,...,i-1
            </t>
            <t>
              There MUST always be a signing key carried in the
              <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx> claim in
              ES[j] that can be used to verify the signature of ES[j-1],
              j=i,...,1 .
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The signing key that MUST be used to verify ES[i] is distributed
          from the trust anchors to the leaf entities in
          some secure out-of-band's way not described in this document.

      </t>

      <t>The federation API endpoint of an entity is resolved from the entity
        identifier. The Federation API endpoint is found using the <xref
                target="RFC5785">Well known URIs
        </xref> specification, with the suffix
        <spanx style="verb">openid-federation</spanx>. The scheme, host and port

        path: <spanx style="verb">/.well-known/openid-federation</spanx>.
      </t>
      <t>*Note* that since the path component of a entity ID is not
        included when constructing the URL above, one API endpoint may
        serve as the federation API endpoint for several entities.
      </t>
      <t>The Federation API is an HTTPS API that may support multiple
        operations. Fetching entity statements is one of the operations, and the

        that all Federation API endpoints are REQUIRED to support. All the
        other operations are OPTIONAL. The list of defined operations may be
        extended in a future.
      </t>

      <t>While all operations in the specification make use of a GET request,
        other operations may choose to use other HTTP methods. If the <spanx
                style="verb">op
        </spanx> parameter is left out, it is considered
        to be a

      <t>An entity (e.g., the Consumer) that wants to establish trust with a
        remote
        peer, must have the remote peer's entity identifier and a list of
        entity ID's of trusted trust anchors together with the public version
        of their signing keys. The Consumer will first have to fetch
        sufficient entity statements to establish at least one chain of trust
        from the remote peer to one or more of the configured trust anchors.
        After that the entity MUST validate the trust chains independently,
        and -- if there are multiple valid trust chains and if the
        application demands it -- choose one.
      </t>
      <section anchor="fetching-es"
               title="Fetching Entity Statements to Establish a Trust Chain">
        <t>Depending on the circumstances, the Consumer may either be
          handed the remote peer's self-issued entity statement or it may
          have to fetch it by itself. If it needs to fetch it, it will use the
          process described in <xref target="fetch_statement">Fetch Entity
            Statements
          </xref> with both *iss* and *sub* set to the entity ID

        <t>The next step is to iterate through the list of
          intermediates listed in
          <spanx style="verb">authority_hints</spanx>
          , ignoring the authority
          hints that end in an unknown trust anchor, requesting an entity
          statement about the remote peer from each of the intermediates.
          If the received entity statement contains an authority hint this
          process is repeated. This time with the *iss* set to the
          intermediates entity ID and the *sub* to be the *iss* of the previous
          query.
          The Consumer should never attempt to fetch
          entity statements it already has fetched during this
          process (loop prevention).
        </t>
        <t>Once the Consumer has found a trust anchor it wants to use it MUST

        <t>A successful operation will return one or more lists of

        </t>
        <t>
          If there is no path from the remote peer to at least one of the
          trusted trust anchors then the list will be empty and there is no
          way of establishing trust in the remote peer's information. How the
          Consumer deals with this is out of scope for this specification.

               anchor="trust_chain_validation">
        <t>As described in
          <xref target="trust_chain">The trust chain</xref>
          a trust chain consists of an ordered list of entity
          statements. So which ever way the Consumer has acquired the set of
          entity statements it must now verify that it is a proper trust chain
          using the rules laid out in that section.
        </t>
        <t>
          To validate the chain, the following must be done:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              For each entity statement ES[j] j=i,..,0 :
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>
                  Verify that the statement contains all the required claims.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Verify that *iat* has a value in the past
                </t>
                <t>
                  Verify that *exp* has a value that is in the future.
                </t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t>
              For j=0,i verify that *iss* == *sub*.
            </t>
            <t>
              For j=1,...,i-1: Verify that ES[j]['iss'] == ES[j+1]['sub']
            </t>
            <t>
              For j=0,...,i-1: Verify the signature of ES[j] using the public
              key carried in ES[j+1]['jwks'].
            </t>
            <t>
              For j == i: verify the signature with the configured public
              key of the trust anchor.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Verifying the signature is a much more expensive
          operation then verifying the correctness of the statement and the
          timestamps. An implementer MAY therefor chose to not verify the
          signature until all the other checks have been done.
        </t>
        <t>
          No information in the chain of statements should be used
          before the signature chain has been validated.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Choosing One of the Valid Trust Chains">
        <t>If multiple valid trust chains are found, the Consumer will
          need to decide on which one to use.
        </t>
        <t>
          One simple rule would be to prefer a shorter chain over a longer
          one.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="trust_lifetime"
               title="Calculating the Lifetime of a Trust Chain">
        <t>
          Each entity statement in a trust chain is signed and MUST have a
          expiration time (exp) set. The expiration time of the whole trust
          chain is set to the minimum value of exp within the chain.
        </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Updating Metadata, Key Rollover, and Revocation">
      <t>This specification allows for a smooth process of updating metadata
        and public keys.
      </t>

      <t>As described above in
        <xref target="trust_lifetime">lifetime calculation</xref>
        each trust chain has a expiration time.
        A consumer of metadata using this specification MUST support
        refreshing a trust chain when it expires.
        How often a consumer SHOULD re-evaluate the trust chain depends on

          The trust anchor SHOULD set a reasonable expiration
          time on that statement, such that the consumers will re-fetch the
          entity statement at reasonable intervals. If the trust root wants to

              Add the new keys to the *jwks* representing the trust

            <t>

      <t>There is two alternative approaches to establish trust between an
        RP and an OP, what we call implicit and explicit
        registration. Members of a federation or a community
        should agree upon which one to use. While implementations should
        support both methods, deployments may choose to disable the use of one
        of them.

        <t>How trust is established and entities becomes part of a federation
          is out of scope of this specification. It could involve some kind
          of non-technical contract, agreement or term of use that is
          established, followed by a federation or trust issuer that registers
          an entity identifier, public key and a set of metadata that restricts
          the delegated trust that is represented in the entity statement about
          the joining party.

          Foodle. Some sort of discovery process involves the end user choosing
          an OPs. OpenID Discovery using the e-mail address is one
          option. Foodle presenting a list of available OPs for the user
          to choose from is another.
        </t>

        <t>After the discovery process, Foodle knows that the user would like
          to login using the OP with entity identifier <spanx

      <section title="Resolving the OP's Trust Chain">
        <t>In order to establish trust with this OP, the Foodle RP
          would need to fetch sufficient entity statements to represent
          a complete chain from the self-issued statement to the locally
          configured trust root, which contains SWAMID.
        </t>

        <t>The information found in the authority_hints is critical in order
          to dynamically discover the trust chain. If such hints are not
          present, the RP may resume to fixed configured trust roots
          to ask for entity statements.
        </t>

        <t>In this example, Foodle now fetches an entity statement from SWAMID
          using the Federation API endpoint of SWAMID, discovered in the
          authority_hints claim.

        <t>Notice that the entity statement about University of Ume&aring;
          also contains an entry for openid_client metadata. This indicates that
          SWAMID expresses this university to be trusted to issue its own OpenID
          clients without the need for registering these directly in SWAMID.
        </t>

        <t>These two entity statements are sufficient to establish a path from
          the local configured trust anchor which trust SWAMID, to the

              Ume&aring;

            <t>Extract the jwks entry from this entity statement. These are

            <t>Check that the sub from the previous statement matches the iss
              of the self-issued statement.
            </t>

            <t>Check that the self-issued statement has the iss and sub to be

        participants disregarding which university/research
        organization/company they belong for.
        To that end the research project have created its own federation (EREE)
        and are expecting the participants to get their organizations OP to
        register with the EREE federation.
        These OPs are of course expected to be members in one or more other
        federations.
        So we have to EREE service and an EREE federation.
        Since the EREE equipment is placed in Sweden the EREE service is also
        member of the SWAMID federation.

        <section title="Resolving the OP's Trust Chain">
          <t>
            In order to establish trust with this OP, the EEPE service
            provider would need to fetch sufficient entity statements to
            represent a complete chain from the self issued statement to the
            trust anchor that represents the EPEE federations.
          </t>
          <t>
            The authority_hints in the self-signed entity statement points to
            2 trust anchors "https://epee.example.org" and "https://swamid.se"
            of these only the *EPEE* one is interesting. The RP therefor chooses
            to only follow that trust path. The next step being fetching an
            entity statement about "https://op.umu.se" signed by the EPEE
            federation. This is done by doing a fetch entity statement:

              </t>
              <t>
                The federation does not have any restrictions on what the OP can
                be configured to do. This means that there are no metadata
                policies to apply to the metadata statement.
              </t>
            </list>

        </section>
        <section title="Validating the Trust Chain">
          <t>These two entity statements are sufficient to establish a path from
            the local configured trust anchor which trust the EPEE federation,
            to the self-issued statement from the OP at the
            University
            of Ume&aring;. Here are the steps performed to validate the trust
            chain as described in
            <xref target="trust_chain_validation">validating the trust
              chain</xref>.
            We start with the signed entity statement issued by EPEE about
            the OP at the University of Ume&aring;
            <list style="numbers">
              <t>Verify that the *sub* in the entity statement is the OPs entity
                ID.
              </t>
              <t>Find the trusted public keys for the EPEE federation in the
                local trust configuration.
              </t>
              <t>Use these keys to validate the signature of the signed entity
                statement. Provided that works out OK
              </t>
              <t>Extract the jwks from the entity statement and convert it to
                a set of keys
              </t>
            </list>
            Now, we can work on the self-signed entity statement published by
            the OP@UmU.
            <list style="numbers">
              <t>Verify that the *sub* and the *iss* in the entity statement is
                the OPs entity ID.
              </t>
              <t>Using the keys extracted above, verify the signature of the

          <t>
            The output from the trust chain validation is an ordered list of
            entity statements. In order to extract the needed metadata, we need
            to look at the metadata type relevant in the given context. In this
            case, we are establishing trust with an OP, and we take
            a look at the *openid_provider* metadata and metadata_policy objects
            of the trust chain:

        <section title="EPEE RP Does Federated Client Registration">
          <t>
            Now when the RP has trusted information about the OP it can do a
            dynamic client registration. To that end it collects information
            about
            itself that it wants to register. This should be no different from
            what a normal OIDC RP does. To this it adds information about the RP
            federation signing keys, the *sub* and *authority_hints*.
            Ones it has all that information it
            creates an entity statement. The result of all this work may look
            something like this:

            To collect the trust chains the OP uses the *authority_hints* in the

            registration request).

            In this case it is only one which points to
            *https://eree.example.org* . So the OP fetches the entity
            statement that the EPEE federation publishes on the EPEE RP.

      <section title="The RP Deals With the Registration Response">
        <t>
          The RP MUST collect the trust chain ending in the EPEE trust anchor
          and
          verify the correctness of the trust chain but refrain from processing
          the metadata. This since the entity statement issued by the EPEE
          federation about the UmU OP are only valid for that entity and not
          for the EPEE RP.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the RP is OK with what the OP decided on regarding the RPs
          metadata then it will store this to be used in the following OIDC
          protocol exchange with the OP.
        </t>
        <t>
          In this example the RP decided on one specific trust anchor before
          sending the registration request. If that was not the case but the
          RP had chosen to send a registration request with more than one
          authority_hint then this by time the RP could not apply any
          metadata polices to the metadata statement since it would not know
          which to use.
