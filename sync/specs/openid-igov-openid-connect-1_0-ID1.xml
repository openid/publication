			<t>The OpenID Connect protocol defines an identity federation system

				increase
				baseline security, provide greater interoperability, and
				structure
				deployments in a manner specifically applicable to (but not
				limited
				to)
				government and public service domains.

		<section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
			<t>Government regulations for permitting users (citizens and
				non-citizens)
				online access to government resources vary greatly from
				region to region.
				There is a strong desire to leverage federated
				authentication and
				identity
				services for public access to government
				resources online to reduce
				'password
				fatigue', increase overall
				account security, reduce cost, and provide
				reliable
				identity
				assurances from established and trusted sources when applicable.
			</t>

			<t>This specification aims to define an OpenID Connect profile that
				provides
				governments with a foundation for securing federated access
				to public services
				online.

				<t>When an iGov-compliant component is interacting with other

				<t>An iGov-compliant OpenID Connect IdP MAY also provide
					iGov-compliant OAuth 2.0 authorization server functionality. In

					features related to interaction between the authorization server
					and

			<section anchor="PairwiseSubject" title="Pairwise Identifiers">
				<t>
					Pairwise  identifiers specified in 
					<xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect Core</xref>
					section 8 help protect an end user's privacy by allowing an OpenID Provider 
					to represent a single user with a 
					different subject identifier (<spanx style="verb">sub</spanx>) for every client the user
					connects to. This technique can help mitigate correlation of a user between multiple clients 
					by preventing the clients from using the subject identifier 
					(the <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> claim) to track a user 
					between different sites and applications. Use of pairwise identifiers 
					does not prevent clients from correlating data based on other identifying 
					attributes such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, document numbers, or other 
					attributes. However, since not all transactions require access to these 
					attributes, but a subject identifier is always required, a pairwise identifier 
					will aid in protecting the privacy of end users as they navigate the system. 
				</t>
				<t> 
					OpenID Providers MUST support pairwaise identifiers for cases where clients
                    require this functionality. OpenID Providers MAY support public identifiers i
                    for frameworks where public identifiers are required, or for cases where public 
                    identifiers are shared as attributes and the framework does not have a requirement for subject
					anonymity. 
				</t>

			</section>

			<section anchor="UserInfoEndpoint" title="UserInfo Endpoint">
				<t>
					OpenID Providers MUST support the UserInfo Endpoint and, at a minimum, the
					<spanx style="verb">sub</spanx>
					(subject) claim. It is expected that the
					<spanx style="verb">sub</spanx>
					claim will remain pseudonymous in use cases where
					obtaining personal
					information is not needed.
				</t>

				<t>Support for a UserInfo Endpoint is important for maximum client
					implementation interoperability even if no additional user
					information is returned.
					Clients are not required to call the
					UserInfo Endpoint, but should not
					receive an error if they do.

            <t>
                Data minimization is an essential concept in trust frameworks and federations 
                exchanging user identity information for government applications. The design of
                this specification takes into consideration mechanisms to protect the user's 
                government identity information and activity from unintentional exposure.
            </t>
            <t> 
                Pairwise anonymous identifiers MUST be supported by the OpenID Providers for
                frameworks where subjects should not be traceable across clients by their 
                subject ID. This prevents a situation where a user may inadvertently be assigned 
                a universal government identifier.
            </t>
            <t>
                Request claims MUST be supported by the OpenID Providers to ensure that only the
                data the client explicitly requests is provided in the UserInfo response. This prevents
                situations where a client may only require a partial set of claims, but receives
                (and is therefore exposed to) a full set of claims. For example, if a client only
                needs a single government document type and number, the OpenID Provider MUST NOT
                send the client the full document information, possibly from multiple documents.
            </t>
            <t>
                Despite the mechanisms enforced by this specification, the operational circumstances
                of a federation may allow these controls to be relaxed. For example, if a framework
                always requires clients to request a national ID number, then the pairwise anonymous 
                identifer requirement may be relaxed. In cases where all clients are entitled to all
                government document claims associated to a subject at an OpenID Provider, the claims 
                request requirement may be relaxed.
            </t>
            <t>
                The reasons for relaxing the controls that support data minimalization are outside
                the scope of this specification.

						<t>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer
							Security (DTLS) are widely used to protect data exchanged over
							application protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP, SIP, and

							have
							emerged, including attacks on its most commonly used cipher
							suites
							and their modes of operation. This document provides
							recommendations for improving the security of deployed services
							that use TLS and DTLS. The recommendations are applicable to the
