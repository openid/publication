This directory contains OpenID Foundation specifications.  It contains
final specifications, implementer's drafts, and working drafts.

When multiple versions of the same spefication appear, the HTML
versions are authoritative, except in the case of YADIS, for which
yadis-v1.0.pdf is authoritative.

In the XML specification sources, ipr= declarations are present to
satisfy the input requriments of the xml2rfc compiler.  These have no
effect on the authoritative specification output and are not
indicative of the actual IPR status of these specifications.
Likewise, while private= declarations are present in the sources to
cause the intended output to be generated by xml2rfc, these are public
OpenID Foundation documents and not an individual private memos, as
private= could be taken to indicate.
