       OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 - draft 02

Abstract

   OpenID Connect is an identity framework that provides authentication,
   authorization, and attribute transmission capability.  It allows
   third party attested claims from distributed sources.  The
   specification suite consists of Core, Protocol Bindings, Dynamic
   Registration, Discovery, and Extensions.  This specification is the
   "Dynamic Registration" part of the suite that defines how clients
   register with OpenID Providers.

1.  Introduction

   In order for an OpenID client to utilize OpenID services for a user,
   the client needs to register with the OpenID Provider to acquire a
   client ID and shared secret.  This document describes how a new
   client can register with the provider, and how a client already in
   possession of a client_id can retrieve updated registration
   information.

   The Client Registration endpoint may be co-resident with the token
   endpoint as an optimization in some deployments.

2.  Terminology

   Client  An application obtaining authorization and making protected
      resource requests.

   End-user  A human resource owner.

   Principal  A human resource owner that is the target of a request in
      Simple Web Discovery.

   OpenID Provider (OP)  Authorization Servers that are able to support
      OpenID Connect Messages.

   Relying Party (RP)  Client and Resource Servers.

   End-User Authorization Endpoint  The Authorization Server's endpoint
      capable of authenticating the End-User and obtaining
      authorization.

   Client Identifier  A unique identifier that the client uses to
      identify itself to the OP.

   Token Endpoint  The Authorization Server's HTTP endpoint capable of
      issuing tokens.

   OP Endpoints  End-User Authentication, Authorization, and Token
      Endpoint.

   RP Endpoints  The endpoint to which the OP responses are returned
      through redirect.

   UserInfo Endpoint  A protected resource that when presented with a
      token by the client returns authorized information about the
      current user.

   Identifier  An Identifier is either an "http" or "https" URI,
      (commonly referred to as a "URL" within this document), or an
      account URI.  This document defines various kinds of Identifiers,
      designed for use in different contexts.

3.  Discovery

   OpenID Connect uses the registration_endpoint from the Provider
   Configuration Response Sec 4.2 [OpenID.CD].

4.  Client Registration Endpoint

   The Client Registration Endpoint returns registration information for
   the client to configure itself for the OpenID Provider.

4.1.  Request

   Clients MAY send POST requests with the following parameters form
   encoded in the POST body to the Client Registration Endpoint.

   type  REQUIRED.  Values "client_associate", "client_update"

   client_id  OPTIONAL.  Used with "client_update"

   client_secret  OPTIONAL.  Used with "client_update"

   contact  OPTIONAL.  Comma separated list e-mail addresses for people
      allowed to administer the application.

   application_type  OPTIONAL. "native" or "web"

   application_name  OPTIONAL.  Name of the application to be presented
      to the user.

   logo_url  OPTIONAL.  URL that a logo for the application can be

                            Abbreviated-Title                  July 2011


   client_secret  REQUIRED.  The client secret.  This should change with
      each response.

   expires_in  REQUIRED.  The number of seconds that this id and secret
      are good for or "0" if it does not expire.

   The following is an example response.

5.  Other Items for Consideration

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   Since requests to the client registration endpoint result in the
   transmission of clear-text credentials (in the HTTP request and
   response), the server MUST require the use of a transport-layer
   security mechanism when sending requests to the token endpoint.  The
   server MUST support TLS 1.2 as defined in [RFC5246], and MAY support
   additional transport-layer mechanisms meeting its security
   requirements.
