           OpenID Connect Simple Web Discovery 1.0 - draft 01

Abstract

   OpenID Connect is an identity framework that provides authentication,
   authorization, and attribute transmition capability.  It allows third
   party attested claims from distributed sources.  The specification
   suite consists of Core, Protocol Bindings, Dynamic Registration,
   Discovery, and Extensions.  This specification is the "Discovery"
   part of the suite that defines how user and server endpoints are
   discovered.

1.  Introduction

   In order for an OpenID client to utilize OpenID services for a user,
   the client needs to know where the OpenID providers and authorization
   servers are located.  OpenID Connect uses Simple Web Discovery [SWD]
   to locate the service endpoints for a end-user.  This document
   describes the OpenID Connect specific parts related to Simple Web
   Discovery [SWD].

2.  Terminology

   Client  An application obtaining authorization and making protected
      resource requests.

   End-user  A human resource owner.

   Principal  A human resource owner that is the target of a request in
      Simple Web Discovery.

   OpenID Provider (OP)  Authorization Servers that are able to support
      OpenID Connect Messages.

   Relying Party (RP)  Client and Resource Servers.

   End-User Authorization Endpoint  The Authorization Server's endpoint
      capable of authenticating the End-User and obtaining
      authorization.

   Client Identifier  An unique identifier that the client uses to
      identify itself to the OP.

   Token Endpoint  The Authorization Server's HTTP endpoint capable of
      issuing tokens.

   OP Endpoints  End-User Authentication, Authorization, and Token
      Endpoint.

   RP Endpoints  The endpoint to which the OP responses are returned
      through redirect.

   UserInfo Endpoint  A protected resource that when presented with a
      token by the client returns authorized information about the
      current user.

   Identifier  An Identifier is either a "http" or "https" URI,
      (commonly referred to as a "URL" within this document), or an
      account URI.  This document defines various kinds of Identifiers,
      designed for use in different contexts.

3.  Discovery

   Simple Web Discovery requires the following information to make a
   discovery request:

   o  principal - identifier of the target end user who is the subject
      of the discovery request

   o  host - server where a Simple Web Discovery service is hosted

   o  service - URI of the service whose location is requested

   OpendID Connect has the following discoverable services:

     +------------------------+-------------------------------------+
     | Service Type           | URI                                 |
     +------------------------+-------------------------------------+
     | Authorization Endpoint | http://openid.net/specs/cc/1.0/auth |
     +------------------------+-------------------------------------+
     +------------------------+-------------------------------------+

   To start discovery of OpenID end points, the end-user supplies an
   identifier to the client or relying party.  The client performs
   normalization rules to the identifier to extract the principal and
   host.  Then it makes a HTTPS request the host's Simple Web Discovery
   endpoint with the "principal" and "service" parameters to obtain the
   location of the requested service.

3.1.  Identifier Normalization

   The user identifier can be one of the following:

   o  Hostname

   o  Email address

   o  URL

   Identifiers starting with the XRI [XRI_Syntax_2.0] characters
   ('=','@', and '!') are reserved.  Any identifier that contains the
   character '@' in any other position other than the first position
   must be treated as an email address.

3.1.1.  Hostname

   If the identifier is the hostname, then the hostname is used as both
   the principal and host in Simple Web Discovery request.  This results
   in a directed identity request.

                            Abbreviated-Title                  June 2011


3.1.2.  Email Address

   If the identifier is an email address, the principal is the email
   address and the host is the portion to the right of the '@'
   character.

3.1.3.  URL

   A URL identifier is normalized according to the following rules:

   o  If the URL does not have a "http" or "https" scheme, the string
      "https://" is prefixed to the URL.

   o  If the URL contains a fragment part, it MUST be stripped off
      together with the fragment delimiter character "#".

   o  The resulting URL is used as the principal and the host is
      extracted from it according to URI [RFC3986] syntax rules.

3.2.  Non-Normative Examples

3.2.1.  Hostname

   To find the authorization endpoint for the given hostname,
   "example.com", the SWD parameters are as follows:

          +---------------+-------------------------------------+
          | SWD Parameter | Value                               |
          +---------------+-------------------------------------+
          | principal     | example.com                         |
          |               |                                     |
          | host          | example.com                         |
          |               |                                     |
          | service       | http://openid.net/specs/cc/1.0/auth |
          +---------------+-------------------------------------+

   Following the SWD specification, the client would make the following
   request to get the discovery information:

GET /.well-known/simple-web-discovery?principal=example.com&service=http://openid.net/specs/cc/1.0/auth HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 O.K.
Content-Type: application/json

{
 "locations":["https://example.com/auth"]
}

3.2.2.  Email Address

   To find the authorization endpoint for the given email address,
   "joe@example.com", the SWD parameters are as follows:

          +---------------+-------------------------------------+
          | SWD Parameter | Value                               |
          +---------------+-------------------------------------+
          | principal     | joe@example.com                     |
          |               |                                     |
          | host          | example.com                         |
          |               |                                     |
          | service       | http://openid.net/specs/cc/1.0/auth |
          +---------------+-------------------------------------+

   Following the SWD specification, the client would make the following
   request to get the discovery information:

GET /.well-known/simple-web-discovery?principal=joe@example.com&service=http://openid.net/specs/cc/1.0/auth HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 O.K.
Content-Type: application/json

{
 "locations":["https://example.com/auth"]
}

3.2.3.  URL

   To find the authorization endpoint for the given URL,
   'https://example.com/joe", the SWD parameters are as follows:

          +---------------+-------------------------------------+
          | SWD Parameter | Value                               |
          +---------------+-------------------------------------+
          | principal     | https://example.com/joe             |
          |               |                                     |
          | host          | example.com                         |
          |               |                                     |
          | service       | http://openid.net/specs/cc/1.0/auth |
          +---------------+-------------------------------------+

   Following the SWD specification, the client would make the following
   request to get the discovery information:

GET /.well-known/simple-web-discovery?principal=https://example.com/joe&service=http://openid.net/specs/cc/1.0/auth HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 O.K.
Content-Type: application/json

{
 "locations":["https://example.com/auth"]
}

3.3.  Redirection

   In cases where the SWD request is handled at a host or location other
   than the one derived from the end-user's identifier, the host will
   return a JSON object containing the new location.

GET /.well-known/simple-web-discovery?principal=joe@example.com&service=http://openid.net/specs/cc/1.0/auth HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 O.K.
Content-Type: application/json

{
 "SWD_service_redirect":
  {
   "location":"https://example.net/swd_server"
  }
}

GET /swd_server?principal=joe@example.com&service=http://openid.net/specs/cc/1.0/auth HTTP/1.1
Host: example.net

HTTP/1.1 200 O.K.
Content-Type: application/json
