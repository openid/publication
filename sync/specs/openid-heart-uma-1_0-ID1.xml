    <abstract>
      <t>The User Managed Access protocol defines a method for an end user to
      introduce a resource to an authorization server, define a set of
      policies governing access to that resource, and for a requesting party
      to provide claims to fulfill those policies in order to gain access to
      the resource.</t>

      <t>This specification profiles the User Managed Access protocol to
      increase baseline security, provide greater interoperability, and
      structure deployments in a manner specifically applicable to (but not
      limited to) the healthcare domain.</t>

      <t>This document profiles the <xref target="UMA">User Managed
      Access</xref> specification for use in the context of securing
      web-facing application programming interfaces (APIs), particularly
      Representational State Transfer (RESTful) APIs, in potentially
      multi-party cross-domain scenarios. Because User Managed Access is built
      on OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 1.0, this profile inherits all
      requirements of the HEART profiles for the use of <xref
      target="HEART.OAuth2">OAuth 2.0</xref> and <xref

      same requirements as regular OAuth clients.</t>

      <t>The authorization server MUST allow for <xref
      target="RFC7591">dynamic client registration</xref> and <xref

      <t>The authorization server MUST indicate to end users that a client or

          <t>directly by the client in the form of an OpenID Connect ID
          Token</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>When the ID token is presented directly to the RPT endpoint, the
      authorization server MUST validate the token, including its audience and
      signature. Since the audience of an ID token is the client's identifier
      with the IdP, and this client identifier is known only to the client and
      the IdP, this restriction effectively means that ID tokens can only be
      presented at the RPT endpoint in the special case when the authorization
      server is also the IdP.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer
            Security (DTLS) are widely used to protect data exchanged over
            application protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP, SIP, and
            XMPP. Over the last few years, several serious attacks on TLS have
            emerged, including attacks on its most commonly used cipher suites
            and their modes of operation. This document provides
            recommendations for improving the security of deployed services
            that use TLS and DTLS. The recommendations are applicable to the
            majority of use cases.</t>
