<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>This document defines a set of requirements for the existing specifications to enable interoperability among Issuers, Wallets, and Verifiers of Credentials where a high level of security and privacy is required. This document is an interoperability profile that can be used by implementations in various contexts, be it a certain industry or a certain regulatory environment. Note that while this profile is aimed at high assurance use-cases, it can also be used for lower assurance use-cases.</t>
<t>This profile aims to achieve a level of security and privacy that includes the following properties:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Authenticity of claims: There is strong assurance that the claims within a Credential or Presentation are valid and bound to the correct Holder. This involves the policies and procedures used to collect and maintain the claims, the authentication of the Holder during issuance, and the protection of claim authenticity both at rest (in the wallet) and during presentation. The scope for this profile is: security of the issuance process, protection of issued credentials, and mechanisms for the Verifiers to access trustworthy information about the Issuer.</li>
<li>Holder authentication: There is strong assurance that the Credential is presented by its legitimate Holder in a given transaction. This involves proof of Holder binding, which can be validated through several methods. The scope for this profile includes secure presentation of key-bound credentials and supporting Claim-based Binding when built on top of this functionality.</li>
</ul>
<t>Note: This profile defines the technical means by which holder authentication can be proven and claim authenticity can be protected using certain protocol and credential format features. Out of scope are concrete holder authentication mechanisms (which ensure only the holder can sign the presentation) and policies and procedures (as this is a technical interop profile and not a policy definition).</t>
<t>Note: This specification fulfils some, but not all, of the requirements to meet the &quot;High&quot; Level of Assurance (LoA) as defined in the eIDAS Regulation <xref target="eIDAS2.0"></xref>. While this profile defines features intended for scenarios targeting a high level of security, these features must be combined with additional measures outside of the scope of HAIP to achieve LoA High compliance.</t>
<t>This document is not a specification, but a profile. It refers to the specifications required for implementations to interoperate among each other and for the optionalities mentioned in the referenced specifications, defines the set of features to be mandatory to implement.</t>
<t>The profile uses OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref> and OpenID for Verifiable Presentations <xref target="OIDF.OID4VP"></xref> as the base protocols for issuance and presentation of Credentials, respectively. The credential formats used are IETF SD-JWT VC as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref> and ISO mdoc <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref>. Additionally, considerations are given on how the issuance of Credentials in both IETF SD-JWT VC <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref> and ISO mdoc <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref> formats can be performed in the same transaction.</t>
<t>A full list of the open standards used in this profile can be found in <xref target="standards-requirements"></xref>.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="out-of-scope"><name>Out of Scope</name>
<t>The following items are out of scope for the current version of this document, but might be added in future versions:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Trust Management refers to authorization of an Issuer to issue certain types of credentials, authorization of the Wallet to be issued certain types of credentials, authorization of the Verifier to receive certain types of credentials. Although X.509 PKI is extensively utilized in this profile, the methods for establishing trust or obtaining root certificates are out of the scope of this specification.</li>
<li>Protocol for presentation of Verifiable Credentials for offline use-cases, e.g. over BLE.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="openid-for-verifiable-credential-issuance"><name>OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance</name>
<t>When implementing OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance, both the Wallet and the Credential Issuer:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>MUST support the authorization code flow.</li>
<li>MUST support at least one of the following Credential Format Profiles defined in <xref target="vc-profiles"></xref>: IETF SD-JWT VC or ISO mdoc. Ecosystems SHOULD clearly indicate which of these formats, IETF SD-JWT VC, ISO mdoc, or both, are required to be supported.</li>
<li>MUST comply with the provisions of <xref target="FAPI2_Security_Profile"></xref> that are applicable to this specification. This includes, but is not limited to using PKCE <xref target="RFC7636"></xref> with <tt>S256</tt> as the code challenge method, Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR) <xref target="RFC9126"></xref> (where applicable) and the <tt>iss</tt> value in the Authorization response <xref target="RFC9207"></xref>.</li>
</ul>
<t>The following aspects of <xref target="FAPI2_Security_Profile"></xref> are further profiled:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Sender-constrained access token: MUST support DPoP as defined in <xref target="RFC9449"></xref>. Note that this requires Wallets to be prepared to handle the <tt>DPoP-Nonce</tt> HTTP response header from the Credential Issuer’s Nonce Endpoint, as well as from other applicable endpoints of the Credential Issuer and Authorization Server.</li>
</ul>
<t>The following aspects of <xref target="FAPI2_Security_Profile"></xref> do not apply to this specification:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Client authentication: Wallet Attestation as defined in <xref target="wallet-attestation"></xref> can be used.</li>
<li>Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR): Only required when using the Authorization Endpoint as defined in Section 5 of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref>.</li>
<li>Cryptography and secrets: <xref target="crypto-suites"></xref> overrides the requirements in Section 5.4.1 clause 1.</li>
</ul>
<t>Note that some optional parts of <xref target="FAPI2_Security_Profile"></xref> are not applicable when using only OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance, e.g., MTLS or OpenID Connect.</t>
<t>Both Wallet initiated and Issuer initiated issuance are supported.</t>
<t>If batch issuance is supported, the Wallet SHOULD use it rather than making consecutive requests for a single Credential of the same Credential Dataset. The Issuer MUST indicate whether batch issuance is supported by including or omitting the <tt>batch_credential_issuance</tt> metadata parameter. The Issuer’s decision may be influenced by various factors, including, but not limited to, trust framework requirements, regulatory constraints, applicable laws or internal policies.</t>
<t>Additional requirements for OpenID4VCI are defined in <xref target="crypto-suites"></xref> and <xref target="hash-algorithms"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="issuer-metadata"><name>Issuer Metadata</name>
<t>The Authorization Server MUST support metadata according to <xref target="RFC8414"></xref>.</t>
<t>The Credential Issuer MUST support metadata retrieval according to Section 12.2.2 of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref>.
The Credential Issuer metadata MUST include a scope for every Credential Configuration it supports.</t>
<t>When ecosystem policies require Issuer Authentication to a higher level than possible with TLS alone, signed Credential Issuer Metadata as specified in Section 11.2.3 in <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref>
MUST be supported by both the Wallet and the Issuer. Key resolution to validate the signed Issuer
Metadata MUST be supported using the <tt>x5c</tt> JOSE header parameter as defined in <xref target="RFC7515"></xref>. In this case, the X.509 certificate of the trust anchor MUST NOT be included in the <tt>x5c</tt> JOSE header of the signed request. The X.509 certificate signing the request MUST NOT be self-signed.</t>
<t>Wallets that render images provided by the Credential Issuer in its metadata defined in Section 12.2.4 of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref> (e.g., the logo of a specific credential) have certain requirements. Such wallets MUST support both the SVG and PNG formats. They also MUST support images conveyed through both data URIs and HTTPS URLs.</t>
<t>If the Issuer supports Credential Configurations that require key binding, as indicated by the presence of <tt>cryptographic_binding_methods_supported</tt>, the <tt>nonce_endpoint</tt> MUST be present in the Credential Issuer Metadata.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="credential-offer"><name>Credential Offer</name>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>The Grant Type <tt>authorization_code</tt> MUST be supported as defined in Section 4.1.1 in <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref></li>
<li>For Grant Type <tt>authorization_code</tt>, the Issuer MUST include a scope value in order to allow the Wallet to identify the desired Credential Type. The Wallet MUST use that value in the <tt>scope</tt> Authorization parameter.</li>
<li>As a way to invoke the Wallet the custom URL scheme <tt>haip-vci://</tt> MAY be supported. Implementations MAY support other ways to invoke Wallets as agreed upon by trust frameworks/ecosystems/jurisdictions, including but not limited to using other custom URL schemes or claimed &quot;https&quot; scheme URIs.</li>
</ul>
<t>Note: The Authorization Code flow does not require a Credential Offer from the Issuer to the Wallet. However, it is included in the feature set to allow for Issuer initiated Credential issuance.</t>
<t>Both Issuer and Wallet MUST support Credential Offer in both same-device and cross-device flows.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="authorization-endpoint"><name>Authorization Endpoint</name>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Wallets MUST authenticate themselves at the PAR endpoint using the same rules as defined in <xref target="token-endpoint"></xref> for client authentication at the token endpoint.</li>
<li>MUST use the <tt>scope</tt> parameter to communicate Credential Type(s) to be issued. The scope value MUST map to a specific Credential Type. The scope value may be pre-agreed, obtained from the Credential Offer, or the Credential Issuer Metadata.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section anchor="token-endpoint"><name>Token Endpoint</name>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Refresh tokens are RECOMMENDED to be supported for Credential refresh. For details, see Section 13.5 in <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref>.</li>
</ul>
<t>Note: Issuers SHOULD consider how long a refresh token is allowed to be used to refresh a credential, as opposed to starting the issuance flow from the beginning. For example, if the User is trying to refresh a Credential more than a year after its original issuance, the usage of the refresh tokens is NOT RECOMMENDED.</t>

<section anchor="wallet-attestation"><name>Wallet Attestation</name>
<t>Wallets MUST use, and Issuers MUST require, an OAuth2 Client authentication mechanism at OAuth2 Endpoints that support client authentication (such as the PAR and Token Endpoints).</t>
<t>Ecosystems that desire wallet-issuer interoperability on the level of Wallet Attestations SHOULD require Wallets to support the authentication mechanism and Wallet Attestation format specified in Annex E of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref>. When doing so, they might need to define additional ecosystem-specific claims contained in the attestation. Alternatively, ecosystems MAY choose to rely on other Wallet Attestation formats.</t>
<t>Additional rules apply when using the format defined in Annex E of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref>:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>the public key certificate, and optionally a trust certificate chain excluding the trust anchor, used to validate the signature on the Wallet Attestation MUST be included in the <tt>x5c</tt> JOSE header of the Client Attestation JWT</li>
<li>Wallet Attestations MUST NOT be reused across different Issuers. They MUST NOT introduce a unique identifier specific to a single Wallet instance. The subject claim for the Wallet Attestation MUST be a value that is shared by all Wallet instances using the present type of wallet implementation. See section 15.4.4 of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref> for details on the Wallet Attestation subject.</li>
<li>if applicable, the <tt>client_id</tt> value in the PAR request MUST be the string in the <tt>sub</tt> value in the client attestation JWT.</li>
<li>Wallets MUST perform client authentication with the Wallet Attestation at OAuth2 Endpoints that support client authentication.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="credential-endpoint"><name>Credential Endpoint</name>

<section anchor="key-attestation"><name>Key Attestation</name>
<t>Wallets MUST support key attestations. Ecosystems that desire wallet-issuer interoperability on the level of key attestations SHOULD require Wallets to support the format specified in Annex D of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref>, in combination with the following proof types:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>jwt</tt> proof type using <tt>key_attestation</tt></li>
<li><tt>attestation</tt> proof type</li>
</ul>
<t>Alternatively, ecosystems MAY choose to rely on other key attestation formats, meaning they would need to use a proof type other than <tt>attestation</tt>, define a new proof type, or expand the <tt>jwt</tt> proof type to support other key attestation formats.</t>
<t>If batch issuance is used and the Credential Issuer has indicated (via <tt>cryptographic_binding_methods_supported</tt> metadata parameter) that cryptographic holder binding is required, all public keys used in Credential Request SHOULD be attested within a single key attestation.</t>
</section>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="openid-for-verifiable-presentations"><name>OpenID for Verifiable Presentations</name>
<t>The following requirements apply to OpenID for Verifiable Presentations, irrespective of the flow and Credential Format:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>The Wallet and Verifier MUST support at least one of the following Credential Format Profiles defined in <xref target="vc-profiles"></xref>: IETF SD-JWT VC or ISO mdoc. Ecosystems SHOULD clearly indicate which of these formats, IETF SD-JWT VC, ISO mdoc, or both, are required to be supported.</li>
<li>The Response type MUST be <tt>vp_token</tt>.</li>
<li>For signed requests, the Verifier MUST use, and the Wallet MUST accept the Client Identifier Prefix <tt>x509_hash</tt> as defined in Section 5.9.3 of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VP"></xref>. The X.509 certificate of the trust anchor MUST NOT be included in the <tt>x5c</tt> JOSE header of the signed request. The X.509 certificate signing the request MUST NOT be self-signed. X.509 certificate profiles to be used with <tt>x509_hash</tt> are out of scope of this specification.</li>
<li>The DCQL query and response as defined in Section 6 of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VP"></xref> MUST be used.</li>
<li>Response encryption MUST be performed as specified in <xref target="OIDF.OID4VP" sectionFormat="of" relative="#" section="8.3"></xref>. The JWE <tt>alg</tt> (algorithm) header parameter (see <xref target="RFC7516" sectionFormat="of" relative="#" section="4.1.1"></xref>)
value <tt>ECDH-ES</tt> (as defined in <xref target="RFC7518" sectionFormat="of" relative="#" section="4.6"></xref>), with key agreement utilizing keys on the <tt>P-256</tt> curve (see <xref target="RFC7518" sectionFormat="of" relative="#" section="6.2.1.1"></xref>) MUST be supported.
The JWE <tt>enc</tt> (encryption algorithm) header parameter (see <xref target="RFC7516" sectionFormat="of" relative="#" section="4.1.2"></xref>) value <tt>A128GCM</tt> (as defined in <xref target="RFC7518" sectionFormat="of" relative="#" section="5.3"></xref>) MUST be supported.</li>
<li>Verifiers MUST use ephemeral encryption keys specific to each Authorization Request passed via client metadata as specified in Section 8.3 of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VP"></xref>.</li>
<li>The Authority Key Identifier (<tt>aki</tt>)-based Trusted Authority Query (<tt>trusted_authorities</tt>) for DCQL, as defined in section 6.1.1.1 of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VP"></xref>, MUST be supported. Note that the Authority Key Identifiers mechanism can be used to support multiple X.509-based trust mechanisms, such as ISO mDL VICAL (as introduced in <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref>) or ETSI Trusted Lists <xref target="ETSI.TL"></xref>. This is achieved by collecting the relevant X.509 certificates for the trusted Issuers and including the encoded Key Identifiers from the certificates in the <tt>aki</tt> array .</li>
</ul>
<t>Additional requirements for OpenID4VP are defined in <xref target="oid4vp-redirects"></xref>, <xref target="oid4vp-dc-api"></xref>, <xref target="oid4vp-credential-formats"></xref>, <xref target="crypto-suites"></xref> and <xref target="hash-algorithms"></xref>.</t>
<t>Note that while this document does not define profiles for X.509 certificates used in Verifier authentication (e.g., with the <tt>x509_hash</tt> Client Identifier Prefix), ecosystems are encouraged to select suitable certificate issuing policies and certificate profiles (for example, an mDL ecosystem can use the Reader Authentication Certificate profile defined in Annex B of ISO/IEC 18013-5 with <tt>x509_hash</tt>), or define new ones if there is a good reason to do so. Such policies and profiles MAY specify how information in the certificate corresponds to information in the presentation flows. For example, an ecosystem might require that the Wallet verifies that the <tt>redirect_uri</tt>, <tt>response_uri</tt>, <tt>origin</tt>, or <tt>expected_origin</tt> request parameters match with information contained in the Verifier's end-entity certificate (e.g., its DNS name).</t>

<section anchor="oid4vp-redirects"><name>OpenID for Verifiable Presentations via Redirects</name>
<t>The following requirements apply to OpenID for Verifiable Presentations via redirects:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>As a way to invoke the Wallet, the custom URL scheme <tt>haip-vp://</tt> MAY be supported by the Wallet and the Verifier. Implementations MAY support other ways to invoke the Wallets as agreed upon by trust frameworks/ecosystems/jurisdictions, including but not limited to using other custom URL schemes or claimed &quot;https&quot; scheme URIs.</li>
<li>Signed Authorization Requests MUST be used by utilizing JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR) <xref target="RFC9101"></xref> with the <tt>request_uri</tt> parameter.</li>
<li>Response encryption MUST be used by utilizing response mode <tt>direct_post.jwt</tt>, as defined in Section 8.3 of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VP"></xref>. Security considerations in Section 14.3 of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VP"></xref> MUST be applied.</li>
<li><t>Verifiers and Wallets MUST support the &quot;same-device&quot; flow. Verifiers are RECOMMENDED to use only the &quot;same-device&quot; flow unless the Verifier does not rely on session binding for phishing resistance, e.g. in a proximity scenario. If &quot;same-device&quot; flow is used, then:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Verifiers MUST include <tt>redirect_uri</tt> in the HTTP response to the Wallet's HTTP POST to the <tt>response_uri</tt>, as defined in Section 8.2 of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VP"></xref>.</li>
<li>Wallets MUST follow the redirect to <tt>redirect_uri</tt>.</li>
<li>Verifiers MUST reject presentations if Wallets do not follow the redirect back or the redirect back arrives in a different user session to the one the request was initiated in.</li>
<li>Implementation considerations can be found in Section 13.3 of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VP"></xref> and security considerations in Section 14.2 of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VP"></xref>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section anchor="oid4vp-dc-api"><name>OpenID for Verifiable Presentations via W3C Digital Credentials API</name>
<t>The following requirements apply to OpenID for Verifiable Presentations via the W3C Digital Credentials API:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Wallet Invocation is done via the W3C Digital Credentials API or an equivalent platform API. Any other mechanism, including Custom URL schemes, MUST NOT be used.</li>
<li>The Response Mode MUST be <tt>dc_api.jwt</tt>.</li>
<li>The Verifier and Wallet MUST use Annex A in <xref target="OIDF.OID4VP"></xref> that defines how to use OpenID4VP over the W3C Digital Credentials API.</li>
<li>The Wallet MUST support both signed and unsigned requests as defined in Annex A.3.1 and A.3.2 of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VP"></xref>. The Verifier MAY support signed requests, unsigned requests, or both.</li>
</ul>
<t>Note that unsigned requests depend on the origin information provided by the platform and the web PKI for request integrity protection and to authenticate the Verifier. Signed requests introduce a separate layer for request integrity protection and Verifier authentication that can be validated by the Wallet.</t>

<section anchor="oid4vp-credential-formats"><name>Requirements specific to Credential Formats</name>

<section anchor="iso-mobile-documents-or-mdocs-iso-iec-18013-and-iso-iec-23220-series"><name>ISO Mobile Documents or mdocs (ISO/IEC 18013 and ISO/IEC 23220 series)</name>
<t>The following requirements apply to all OpenID4VP flows when the mdoc Credential Format is used:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>The Credential Format identifier MUST be <tt>mso_mdoc</tt>.</li>
<li>When multiple ISO mdocs are being returned, each ISO mdoc MUST be returned in a separate <tt>DeviceResponse</tt> (as defined in 8.3.2.1.2.2 of <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref>), each matching to a respective DCQL query. Therefore, the resulting <tt>vp_token</tt> contains multiple <tt>DeviceResponse</tt> instances.</li>
<li>The Credential Issuer MAY include the MSO revocation mechanism in the issued mdoc. When doing so, it MUST use one of the mechanisms defined in ISO/IEC 18013-5 (<xref target="ISO.18013-5.second.edition"></xref>).</li>

<t>Credential Format Profiles are defined as follows:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><t>IETF SD-JWT VCs (as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref>), subject to the additional requirements defined in <xref target="sd-jwt-vc"></xref>:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">

<li><xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref> – Annex A.2</li>
<li><xref target="OIDF.OID4VP"></xref> – Annex B.2</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section anchor="sd-jwt-vc"><name>IETF SD-JWT VC Profile</name>
<t>This profile defines the following additional requirements for IETF SD-JWT VCs as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref>.</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Compact serialization MUST be supported as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt"></xref>. JSON serialization MAY be supported.</li>
<li>It is RECOMMENDED that Issuers limit the validity period when issuing SD-JWT VC. When doing so, the Issuer MUST use an <tt>exp</tt> claim, a <tt>status</tt> claim, or both.</li>
<li>The <tt>cnf</tt> claim <xref target="RFC7800"></xref> MUST conform to the definition given in <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref>. Implementations conforming to this profile MUST include the JSON Web Key <xref target="RFC7517"></xref> in the <tt>jwk</tt> member if the corresponding Credential Configuration requires cryptographic holder binding.</li>
<li>The <tt>status</tt> claim, if present, MUST contain <tt>status_list</tt> as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-status-list"></xref></li>
<li>The public key used to validate the signature on the Status List Token defined in [I-D.ietf-oauth-status-list] MUST be included in the <tt>x5c</tt> JOSE header of the Token. The X.509 certificate of the trust anchor MUST NOT be included in the <tt>x5c</tt> JOSE header of the Status List Token. The X.509 certificate signing the request MUST NOT be self-signed.</li>
</ul>
<t>Each Credential MUST have its own unique, unpredictable status list index, even when multiple Credentials reference the same status list URI (see section 13.2 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-status-list"></xref>). Refer to section 12.5 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-status-list"></xref> for additional privacy considerations on unlinkability.</t>
<t>Note: For guidance on preventing linkability by colluding parties, such as Issuer/Verifier pairs, multiple Verifiers, or repeated interactions with the same Verifier, see Section 15.4.1 of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref> and Section 15.5 of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VP"></xref>.</t>
<t>Note: If there is a requirement to communicate information about the verification status and identity assurance data of the claims about the subject, the syntax defined by <xref target="OIDF.ekyc-ida"></xref> SHOULD be used. It is up to each jurisdiction and ecosystem, whether to require it to the implementers of this profile.</t>
<t>Note: If there is a requirement to provide the Subject’s identifier assigned and maintained by the Issuer, the <tt>sub</tt> claim MAY be used. There is no requirement for a binding to exist between the <tt>sub</tt> and <tt>cnf</tt> claims. See the Implementation Considerations section in <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref>.</t>
<t>Note: In some Credential Types, it is not desirable to include an expiration date (e.g., diploma attestation). Therefore, this profile leaves its inclusion to the Issuer, or the body defining the respective Credential Type.</t>

<section anchor="issuer-key-resolution"><name>Issuer identification and key resolution to validate an issued Credential</name>
<t>This profile mandates the support for X.509 certificate-based key resolution to validate the issuer signature of an SD-JWT VC. This MUST be supported by all entities (Issuer, Wallet, Verifier). The SD-JWT VC MUST contain the credential issuer's signing certificate along with a trust chain in the <tt>x5c</tt> JOSE header parameter as described in section 3.5 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref>. The X.509 certificate of the trust anchor MUST NOT be included in the <tt>x5c</tt> JOSE header of the SD-JWT VC. The X.509 certificate signing the request MUST NOT be self-signed.</t>

<section anchor="cryptographic-holder-binding-between-vc-and-vp"><name>Cryptographic Holder Binding between VC and VP</name>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>If the credential has cryptographic holder binding, a KB-JWT, as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref>, MUST always be present when presenting an SD-JWT VC.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="crypto-suites"><name>Crypto Suites</name>
<t>Issuers, Verifiers, and Wallets MUST, at a minimum, support ECDSA with P-256 and SHA-256 (JOSE algorithm identifier <tt>ES256</tt>; COSE algorithm identifier <tt>-7</tt>, as applicable) for the purpose of validating the following:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><t>Issuers</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Wallet Attestations (including PoP) when Annex E of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref> is used;</li>
<li>Key Attestations when Annex D of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref> is used.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><t>Verifiers</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>the signature of the Verifiable Presentation, e.g., KB-JWT of an SD-JWT VC, or <tt>deviceSignature</tt> CBOR structure in case of ISO mdocs. Verifiers are assumed to determine in advance the cryptographic suites supported by the ecosystem, e.g. mDL Issuers/Verifiers implementing ISO mdocs.</li>
<li>the status information of the Verifiable Credential or Wallet Attestation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><t>Wallets</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>signed presentation requests.</li>
<li>signed Issuer metadata.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<t>Ecosystem-specific profiles MAY mandate additional cryptographic suites.</t>
<t>When using this profile alongside other crypto suites, each entity SHOULD make it explicit in its metadata which other algorithms and key types are supported for the cryptographic operations.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="hash-algorithms"><name>Hash Algorithms</name>
<t>The hash algorithm SHA-256 MUST be supported by all the entities to generate and validate the digests in the IETF SD-JWT VC and ISO mdoc.</t>
<t>Ecosystem-specific profiles MAY mandate additional hashing algorithms.</t>
<t>When using this profile alongside other hash algorithms, each entity SHOULD make it explicit in its metadata which other algorithms are supported.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="implementation-considerations"><name>Implementation Considerations</name>

<section anchor="requirements-for-browser-os-support-of-specific-features"><name>Requirements for browser/OS support of specific features</name>
<t>This specification relies on certain prerequisites, such as browser or operating system support for specific features. When these prerequisites are mandatory for a flow (e.g., the W3C Digital Credentials API or an equivalent platform API), an implementer might be unable to support that flow due to factors beyond their control. In other cases (e.g., custom URL schemes), the prerequisites are optional, allowing implementers to achieve the same flow through alternative mechanisms.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="interoperable-key-attestations"><name>Interoperable Key Attestations</name>
<t>Wallet implementations using the key attestation format specified in Annex D of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref> might need to utilize a transformation (backend) service to create such attestations based on data as provided in other formats by the respective platform or secure key management module. The dependency on such a service might impact the availability of the wallet app as well as the performance of the issuance process. This could be mitigated by creating keys and obtaining the respective key attestations in advance.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="ecosystem-implementation-considerations"><name>Ecosystem Implementation Considerations</name>
<t>This document intentionally leaves certain extensions for ecosystems to define, in order to enable broad compatibility across differing or even conflicting requirements. These include:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Whether to adopt the Presentation profile, Issuance profile, or both</li>
<li>Which Credential format to support across issuance and presentation</li>
<li>Whether to use Signed Issuer Metadata or not</li>
<li>How to send Credential Offer</li>
<li>Which Key attestation format to use</li>
<li>Which Wallet attestation format to use</li>
<li>X509 certificate profiles</li>
<li>Whether to use DC API, Redirects with custom URL schemes  and/or Redirects with claimed <tt>https</tt> scheme URIs for presentation</li>
<li>Support or restriction of additional cryptographic suites and hash algorithms</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="security_considerations"><name>Security Considerations</name>
<t>Note that security considerations for OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance are defined in Section 13 of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref> and for OpenID for Verifiable Presentations in Section 14 (for redirect based flows) or Section A.5 (for DC API) of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VP"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="incomplete-or-incorrect-implementations-of-the-specifications-and-conformance-testing"><name>Incomplete or Incorrect Implementations of the Specifications and Conformance Testing</name>
<t>To achieve the full security benefits, it is important that the implementation of this specification, and the underlying specifications, are both complete and correct.</t>
<t>The OpenID Foundation provides tools that can be used to confirm that an implementation is correct and conformant:</t>
<t><eref target="https://openid.net/certification/conformance-testing-for-openid-for-verifiable-credential-issuance/">https://openid.net/certification/conformance-testing-for-openid-for-verifiable-credential-issuance/</eref></t>

</section>

<section anchor="key-sizes"><name>Key sizes</name>
<t>Implementers need to ensure appropriate key sizes are used. Guidance can be found in, for example, <xref target="NIST.SP.800-131A"></xref>, <xref target="NIST.SP.800-57"></xref> or <xref target="BSI.TR-02102-1"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="privacy-considerations"><name>Privacy Considerations</name>

<section anchor="interop-key-attestations"><name>Interoperable Key Attestations</name>
<t>Wallet implementations using the key attestation format specified in Annex D of <xref target="OIDF.OID4VCI"></xref> might need to utilize a transformation (backend) service to create such attestations based on data as provided in other formats by the respective platform or secure key management module. Such a backend service MUST be designed considering the privacy of its users. For example, the service could be stateless and just perform the transformation of the attestation data without binding the process in any way to a unique user identifier.</t>
