           OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0 - draft 03

Abstract

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
   based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
   well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
   interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This specification defines a logout mechanism that uses front-channel
   communication via the User Agent between the OP and RPs being logged
   out that does not need an OpenID Provider iframe on Relying Party
   pages.  Other protocols have used HTTP GETs to RP URLs that clear
   login state to achieve this.  This specification does the same thing.
   It also reuses the RP-initiated logout functionality specified in
   Section 5 of OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 (RP-Initiated
   Logout).

                 OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0       July 2020


1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749] protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the
   End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization
   Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-
   User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This specification defines a logout mechanism that uses front-channel
   communication via the User Agent between the OP and RPs being logged
   out that does not need an OpenID Provider iframe on Relying Party
   pages, as OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 [OpenID.Session]
   does.  Other protocols have used HTTP GETs to RP URLs that clear
   login state to achieve this; this specification does the same thing.

   In contrast, the OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0
   [OpenID.BackChannel] specification uses direct back-channel
   communication between the OP and RPs being logged out; this differs
   from front-channel logout mechanisms, which communicate logout
   requests from the OP to RPs via the User Agent.  The OpenID Connect
   RP-Initiated Logout 1.0 [OpenID.RPInitiated] specification
   complements these specifications by defining a mechanism for a
   Relying Party to request that an OpenID Provider log out the End-
   User.

   This specification can be used separately from or in combination with
   OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0, OpenID Connect Session
   Management 1.0, and/or OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   In the .txt version of this specification, values are quoted to
   indicate that they are to be taken literally.  When using these
   values in protocol messages, the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of
   the value.  In the HTML version of this specification, values to be
   taken literally are indicated by the use of "this fixed-width font".

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Authorization Server", "Client",
   "Client Identifier", and "Redirection URI" defined by OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749], the term "User Agent" defined by RFC 7230 [RFC7230], and
   the terms defined by OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core].

   This specification also defines the following terms:

   Session
      Continuous period of time during which an End-User accesses a
      Relying Party relying on the Authentication of the End-User
      performed by the OpenID Provider.

   Session ID
      Identifier for a Session.

2.  Relying Party Logout Functionality

   RPs supporting HTTP-based logout register a logout URI with the OP as
   part of their client registration.  The domain, port, and scheme of
   this URL MUST be the same as that of a registered Redirection URI
   value.

   The logout URI MUST be an absolute URI as defined by Section 4.3 of
   [RFC3986].  The logout URI MAY include an
   "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" formatted query component, per
   Section 3.4 of [RFC3986], which MUST be retained when adding
   additional query parameters.  The logout URI MUST NOT include a
   fragment component.

   The OP renders "<iframe src="frontchannel_logout_uri">" in a page
   with the registered logout URI as the source to trigger the logout
   actions by the RP.  Upon receiving a request to render the logout URI
   in an iframe, the RP clears state associated with the logged-in
   session, including any cookies and HTML5 local storage.

   The OP MAY add these query parameters when rendering the logout URI,
   and if either is included, both MUST be:

   iss
      Issuer Identifier for the OP issuing the front-channel logout
      request.

   sid
      Identifier for the Session.

   The RP's response SHOULD include "Cache-Control" directives keeping
   the response from being cached to prevent cached responses from
   interfering with future logout requests.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   these directives be used:

     Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store
     Pragma: no-cache

   In the case that the RP is also an OP serving as an identity provider
   to downstream logged-in sessions, it is desirable for the logout
   request to the RP to likewise trigger downstream logout requests.
   This is achieved by having the RP serve content in the iframe that
   contains logout requests to the downstream sessions, which themselves
   are nested iframes rendering the downstream logout URIs.

   If the RP supports OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0
   [OpenID.Registration], it uses this metadata value to register the
   logout URI:



Jones                                                           [Page 5]

                 OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0       July 2020


   frontchannel_logout_uri
      OPTIONAL.  RP URL that will cause the RP to log itself out when
      rendered in an iframe by the OP.  An "iss" (issuer) query
      parameter and a "sid" (session ID) query parameter MAY be included
      by the OP to enable the RP to validate the request and to
      determine which of the potentially multiple sessions is to be
      logged out; if either is included, both MUST be.

   It SHOULD also register this related metadata value:

   frontchannel_logout_session_required
      OPTIONAL.  Boolean value specifying whether the RP requires that
      "iss" (issuer) and "sid" (session ID) query parameters be included
      to identify the RP session with the OP when the
      "frontchannel_logout_uri" is used.  If omitted, the default value
      is "false".



































Jones                                                           [Page 6]

3.  OpenID Provider Logout Functionality

   OPs supporting HTTP-based logout need to keep track of the set of
   logged-in RPs so that they know what RPs to contact at their logout
   URIs to cause them to log out.  Some OPs track this state using a
   "visited sites" cookie.  OPs contact them in parallel using a
   dynamically constructed page with HTML "<iframe
   src="frontchannel_logout_uri">" tags rendering each logged-in RP's
   logout URI.

   If the OP supports OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 [OpenID.Discovery],
   it uses this metadata value to advertise its support for HTTP-based
   logout:

   frontchannel_logout_supported
      OPTIONAL.  Boolean value specifying whether the OP supports HTTP-
      based logout, with "true" indicating support.  If omitted, the
      default value is "false".

   It SHOULD also register this related metadata value:

   frontchannel_logout_session_supported
      OPTIONAL.  Boolean value specifying whether the OP can pass "iss"
      (issuer) and "sid" (session ID) query parameters to identify the
      RP session with the OP when the "frontchannel_logout_uri" is used.
      If supported, the "sid" Claim is also included in ID Tokens issued
      by the OP.  If omitted, the default value is "false".

   The "sid" (session ID) Claim used in ID Tokens and as a
   "frontchannel_logout_uri" parameter has the following definition:

   sid
      OPTIONAL.  Session ID - String identifier for a Session.  This
      represents a Session of a User Agent or device for a logged-in
      End-User at an RP.  Different "sid" values are used to identify
      distinct sessions at an OP.  The "sid" value need only be unique
      in the context of a particular issuer.  Its contents are opaque to
      the RP.  Its syntax is the same as an OAuth 2.0 Client Identifier.

3.1.  Example Front-Channel Logout URL Usage

   In this non-normative example, the RP has registered the
   "frontchannel_logout_uri" value
   "https://rp.example.org/frontchannel_logout"" with the OP.  In the
   simple case, in which "frontchannel_logout_session_required" is
   false, the OP causes the front-channel logout to occur by rendering
   this URL in an iframe:




Jones                                                           [Page 7]

                 OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0       July 2020


     https://rp.example.org/frontchannel_logout

   In a second example, in which "frontchannel_logout_session_required"
   is true, Issuer and Session ID values are also sent.  This example
   uses an Issuer value of "https://server.example.com" and a Session ID
   value of "08a5019c-17e1-4977-8f42-65a12843ea02".  In this case, the
   OP causes the front-channel logout to occur by rendering this URL in
   an iframe (with line breaks for display purposes only):

     https://rp.example.org/frontchannel_logout
       ?iss=https://server.example.com
       &sid=08a5019c-17e1-4977-8f42-65a12843ea02

4.  Security Considerations

   Collisions between Session IDs and the guessing of their values by
   attackers are prevented by including sufficient entropy in Session ID
   values.
