        An extension to the OpenID Connect Authentication Framework
        defining a new value for the <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx>
        parameter that instructs the OpenID Provider to start the user flow with
        user registration and after the user account has been created return an
        authorization code to the client to complete the authentication flow.

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        Several years of deployment and implementation experience with <xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</xref>
        has uncovered a need, in some circumstances, for the client to explicitly signal to the OpenID Provider that the user
        desires to create a new account rather than authenticate an existing identity.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification allows the client to indicate to the OpenID Provider that the user desires to create an account
        improving the user experience by reducing the friction for the user of finding the sign-up link on the default login page.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification defines a new value for the <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx> parameter.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="rnc" title="Requirements Notation and Conventions">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

        <t>
          In the .txt version of this specification,
          values are quoted to indicate that they are to be taken literally.
          When using these values in protocol messages,
          the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.
          In the HTML version of this specification,
          values to be taken literally are indicated by
          the use of <spanx style="verb">this fixed-width font</spanx>.
        </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Terminology" title="Terminology">
      <t>
        This specification uses the terms
        "authorization endpoint",
        "authorization request",
        "authorization response",
        and "client"
        defined by <xref target="RFC6749">The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework</xref>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="PromptParameter" title="Prompt Parameter">
      <t>
        In requests to the OpenID Provider, a client MAY indicate that the desired user experience is for the
        user to immediately see the user account creation UI instead of the login behavior.

      <list style="hanging">

      <t hangText="prompt">
        <vspace/>
        A value of <spanx style="verb">create</spanx> indicates to the OpenID Provider that
        the client desires that the user be shown the account creation UX rather than the
        login flow. Care must be taken if combining this value with other <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx> values.
        Mutually exclusive conditions can arise so it is RECOMMENDED that <spanx style="verb">create</spanx>
        not be combined with any other values.
      </t>
      </list>

      </t>

      <section anchor="authz-req" title="Authorization Request">
      <t>
        When the <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx> parameter is used in an
        authorization request to the authorization endpoint with the value of
        <spanx style="verb">create</spanx>, it indicates that the user has
        chosen to be shown the account creation experience rather than the
        login experience. Whether the AS creates a brand new identity or helps
        the user authenticate an identity they already have is out of scope for
        this specification. The behavior is the same for all response types.
      </t>
      <t>
        For authorization requests sent as a JWT, such as when using
        Section 6 of <xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</xref>,
        the <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx> claim value MUST be a space delimited set
        of prompt values in keeping with Section 3.1.2.1 of OpenID Connect
        Core 1.0.
      </t>
      <t>
        If the OpenID Provider receives a prompt value that it does not support (not declared in the
        <spanx style="verb">prompt_values_supported</spanx> metadata field) the OP SHOULD respond with
        an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code and an error value of <spanx style="verb">invalid_request</spanx>.
        It is RECOMMENDED that the OP return an error_description value identifying the invalid parameter value.
      </t>

      <t>
          In <xref target="authz-endpoint-example-code"/> is an example of an authorization request
          using the <spanx style="verb">code</spanx> response type
          where the client tells the OpenID Provider that it wants the user to
          start from the account creation user experience
          (extra line breaks and indentation are for display purposes only).

      <t>
         This specification extends the OpenID Connect Discovery Metadata
         <xref target="OpenID.Discovery">Section 3</xref> and defines the following:

         <list style="hanging">

         <t hangText="prompt_values_supported">
           <vspace/>
           OPTIONAL. JSON array containing the list of prompt values that this
           OP supports.
         </t>
         </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        This metadata element is OPTIONAL in the context of the OpenID Provider
        not supporting the <spanx style="verb">create</spanx> value. If omitted,
        the Relying Party should assume that this specification is not
        supported. The OpenID Provider MAY provide this metadata element even
        if it doesn't support the <spanx style="verb">create</spanx> value.
      </t>
      <t>
         Specific to this specification, a value of
         <spanx style="verb">create</spanx> in the array indicates to the Relying party
         that this OpenID Provider supports this specification. If an OpenID
         Provider supports this specification it MUST define this metadata
         element in the openid-configuration file. Additionally, if this
         metadata element is defined by the OpenID Provider, the OP must
         also specify all other prompt values which it supports.
      </t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        No known security considerations exist for this specification.
