<t>This specification defines a protocol for requesting and presenting Verifiable Credentials.</t>
</abstract>

</front>

<middle>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>This specification defines a mechanism on top of OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"></xref> that enables presentation of Verifiable Credentials as Verifiable Presentations. Verifiable Credentials and Verifiable Presentations can be of any format, including, but not limited to W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model <xref target="VC_DATA"></xref>, ISO mdoc <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref>, IETF SD-JWT VC <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref>, and AnonCreds <xref target="Hyperledger.Indy"></xref>.</t>
<t>OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"></xref> is used as a base protocol as it provides the required rails to build a simple, secure, and developer-friendly Credential presentation layer on top of it. Moreover, implementers can, in a single interface, support Credential presentation and the issuance of Access Tokens for access to APIs based on Verifiable Credentials in the Wallet. OpenID Connect <xref target="OpenID.Core"></xref> deployments can also extend their implementations using this specification with the ability to transport Verifiable Presentations.</t>
<t>This specification can also be combined with <xref target="SIOPv2"></xref>, if implementers require OpenID Connect features, such as the issuance of Self-Issued ID Tokens <xref target="SIOPv2"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="requirements-notation-and-conventions"><name>Requirements Notation and Conventions</name>
<t>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="terminology"><name>Terminology</name>
<t>This specification uses the terms &quot;Access Token&quot;, &quot;Authorization Request&quot;, &quot;Authorization Response&quot;, &quot;Client&quot;, &quot;Client Authentication&quot;, &quot;Client Identifier&quot;, &quot;Grant Type&quot;, &quot;Response Type&quot;, &quot;Token Request&quot; and &quot;Token Response&quot; defined by OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>, the terms &quot;End-User&quot;, &quot;Entity&quot;, &quot;Request Object&quot;, &quot;Request URI&quot; as defined by OpenID Connect Core <xref target="OpenID.Core"></xref>, the term &quot;JSON Web Token (JWT)&quot; defined by JSON Web Token (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519"></xref>, the term &quot;JOSE Header&quot; defined by JSON Web Signature (JWS) <xref target="RFC7515"></xref>, the term &quot;JSON Web Encryption (JWE)&quot; defined by <xref target="RFC7516"></xref>, and the term &quot;Response Mode&quot; defined by OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices <xref target="OAuth.Responses"></xref>.</t>
<t>Base64url-encoded denotes the URL-safe base64 encoding without padding defined in Section 2 of <xref target="RFC7515"></xref>.</t>
<t>This specification also defines the following terms. In the case where a term has a definition that differs, the definition below is authoritative.</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt>Credential:</dt>
<dd>A set of one or more claims about a subject made by a Credential Issuer. Note that the definition of the term &quot;Credential&quot; in this specification is different from that in <xref target="OpenID.Core"></xref>.</dd>
<dt>Digital Credentials API:</dt>
<dd>The Digital Credentials API (DC API) refers to the W3C Digital Credentials API <xref target="W3C.Digital_Credentials_API"></xref> on the Web Platform and its equivalent native APIs on App Platforms (such as <eref target="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/credentials">Credential Manager on Android</eref>).</dd>
<dt>Verifiable Credential (VC):</dt>
<dd>An Issuer-signed Credential whose authenticity can be cryptographically verified. Can be of any format used in the Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model, including, but not limited to those defined in <xref target="VC_DATA"></xref> (VCDM), <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref> (mdoc), <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref> (SD-JWT VC), and <xref target="Hyperledger.Indy"></xref> (AnonCreds).</dd>
<dt>W3C Verifiable Credential:</dt>
<dd>A Verifiable Credential compliant to the <xref target="VC_DATA"></xref> specification.</dd>
<dt>Presentation:</dt>
<dd>Data that is presented to a specific Verifier, derived from one or more Verifiable Credentials that can be from the same or different Credential Issuers.</dd>
<dt>Verifiable Presentation (VP):</dt>
<dd>A Holder-signed Credential whose authenticity can be cryptographically verified to provide Cryptographic Holder Binding. Can be of any format used in the Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model, including, but not limited to those defined in <xref target="VC_DATA"></xref> (VCDM), <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref> (mdoc), <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref> (SD-JWT VC), and <xref target="Hyperledger.Indy"></xref> (AnonCreds).</dd>
<dt>W3C Verifiable Presentation:</dt>
<dd>A Verifiable Presentations compliant to the <xref target="VC_DATA"></xref> specification.</dd>
<dt>Credential Issuer:</dt>
<dd>An entity that issues Verifiable Credentials. Also called Issuer.</dd>
<dt>Holder:</dt>
<dd>An entity that receives Verifiable Credentials and has control over them to present them to the Verifiers as Verifiable Presentations.</dd>
<dt>Verifier:</dt>
<dd>An entity that requests, receives, and validates Verifiable Presentations. During presentation of Credentials, Verifier acts as an OAuth 2.0 Client towards the Wallet that is acting as an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server. The Verifier is a specific case of OAuth 2.0 Client, just like Relying Party (RP) in <xref target="OpenID.Core"></xref>.</dd>
<dt>Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model:</dt>
<dd>A model for exchanging claims, where claims are issued in the form of Verifiable Credentials independent of the process of presenting them as Verifiable Presentation to the Verifiers. An issued Verifiable Credential can (but must not necessarily) be used multiple times.</dd>
<dt>Holder Binding:</dt>
<dd>Ability of the Holder to prove legitimate possession of a Verifiable Credential.</dd>
<dt>Cryptographic Holder Binding:</dt>
<dd>Ability of the Holder to prove legitimate possession of a Verifiable Credential by proving control over the same private key during the issuance and presentation. Mechanism might depend on the Credential Format. For example, in <tt>jwt_vc_json</tt> Credential Format, a Verifiable Credential with Cryptographic Holder Binding contains a public key or a reference to a public key that matches to the private key controlled by the Holder.</dd>
<dt>Claims-based Holder Binding:</dt>
<dd>Ability of the Holder to prove legitimate possession of a Verifiable Credential by proofing certain claims, e.g., name and date of birth, for example by presenting another Verifiable Credential. Claims-based Holder Binding allows long term, cross device use of a Credential as it does not depend on cryptographic key material stored on a certain device. One example of such a Verifiable Credential could be a Diploma.</dd>
<dt>Biometrics-based Holder Binding:</dt>
<dd>Ability of the Holder to prove legitimate possession of a Verifiable Credential by demonstrating a certain biometric trait, such as finger print or face. One example of a Verifiable Credential with biometric Holder Binding is a mobile driving license <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref>, which contains a portrait of the Holder.</dd>
<dt>VP Token:</dt>
<dd>An artifact containing one or more Verifiable Presentations returned as a response to an Authorization Request. The structure of VP Tokens is defined in <xref target="response-parameters"></xref>.</dd>
<dt>Wallet:</dt>
<dd>An entity used by the Holder to receive, store, present, and manage Verifiable Credentials and key material. There is no single deployment model of a Wallet: Verifiable Credentials and keys can both be stored/managed locally, or by using a remote self-hosted service, or a remote third-party service. In the context of this specification, the Wallet acts as an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server (see <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>) towards the Credential Verifier which acts as the OAuth 2.0 Client.</dd>
</dl>
</section>

<section anchor="overview"><name>Overview</name>
<t>This specification defines a mechanism on top of OAuth 2.0 to request and present Verifiable Credentials as Verifiable Presentations.</t>
<t>As the primary extension, OpenID for Verifiable Presentations introduces the VP Token as a container to enable End-Users to present Verifiable Presentations to Verifiers using the Wallet. A VP Token contains one or more Verifiable Presentations in the same or different Credential formats.</t>
<t>This specification supports any Credential format used in the Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model, including, but not limited to those defined in <xref target="VC_DATA"></xref> (VCDM), <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref> (mdoc), <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref> (SD-JWT VC), and <xref target="Hyperledger.Indy"></xref> (AnonCreds). Credentials of multiple formats can be presented in the same transaction. The examples given in the main part of this specification use W3C Verifiable Credentials, while examples in other Credential formats are given in <xref target="format_specific_parameters"></xref>.</t>
<t>Implementations can use any pre-existing OAuth 2.0 Grant Type and Response Type in conjunction with this specification to support different deployment architectures.</t>
<t>OpenID for Verifiable Presentations supports scenarios where the Authorization Request is sent both when the Verifier is interacting with the End-User using the device that is the same or different from the device on which requested Credential(s) are stored.</t>
<t>This specification supports the response being sent using a redirect but also using an HTTP POST request. This enables the response to be sent across devices, or when the response size exceeds the redirect URL character size limitation.</t>
<t>Implementations can also be built on top of OpenID Connect Core, which is also based on OAuth 2.0. To benefit from the Self-Issued ID Token feature, this specification can also be combined with the Self-Issued OP v2 specification <xref target="SIOPv2"></xref>.</t>
<t>Any of the OAuth 2.0 related specifications, such as <xref target="RFC9126"></xref> and <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>, and Best Current Practice (BCP) documents, such as <xref target="RFC8252"></xref> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-security-topics"></xref>, can be implemented on top of this specification.</t>
<t>In summary, OpenID for Verifiable Presentations is a framework that requires profiling
to achieve interoperability. Profiling means defining:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>what optional features are used or mandatory to implement, e.g., response encryption;</li>
<li>which values are permitted for parameters, e.g., credential format identifiers;</li>
<li>optionally, extensions for new features.</li>
</ul>

<section anchor="same_device"><name>Same Device Flow</name>
<t>Below is a diagram of a flow where the End-User presents a Credential to a Verifier interacting with the End-User on the same device that the device the Wallet resides on.</t>
<t>The flow utilizes simple redirects to pass Authorization Request and Response between the Verifier and the Wallet. The Verifiable Presentations are returned to the Verifier in the fragment part of the redirect URI, when Response Mode is <tt>fragment</tt>.</t>
<t>Note: The diagram does not illustrate all the optional features of this specification.</t>

<t>(1) The Verifier sends an Authorization Request to the Wallet. It contains a Presentation Definition as defined in <xref target="DIF.PresentationExchange"></xref> that describes the requirements of the Credential(s) that the Verifier is requesting to be presented. Such requirements could include what type of Credential(s), in what format(s), which individual Claims within those Credential(s) (Selective Disclosure), etc. The Wallet processes the Authorization Request and determines what Credentials are available matching the Verifier's request. The Wallet also authenticates the End-User and gathers consent to present the requested Credentials.</t>
<t>(2) The Wallet prepares the Verifiable Presentation(s) of the Verifiable Credential(s) that the End-User has consented to. It then sends to the Verifier an Authorization Response where the Verifiable Presentation(s) are contained in the <tt>vp_token</tt> parameter.</t>

<section anchor="cross_device"><name>Cross Device Flow</name>
<t>Below is a diagram of a flow where the End-User presents a Credential to a Verifier interacting with the End-User on a different device as the device the Wallet resides on.</t>
<t>In this flow, the Verifier prepares an Authorization Request and renders it as a QR Code. The End-User then uses the Wallet to scan the QR Code. The Verifiable Presentations are sent to the Verifier in a direct HTTP POST request to a URL controlled by the Verifier. The flow uses the Response Type <tt>vp_token</tt> in conjunction with the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt>, both defined in this specification. In order to keep the size of the QR Code small and be able to sign and optionally encrypt the Request Object, the actual Authorization Request contains just a Request URI according to <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>, which the wallet uses to retrieve the actual Authorization Request data.</t>
<t>Note: The diagram does not illustrate all the optional features of this specification.</t>
<t>Note: The usage of the Request URI as defined in <xref target="RFC9101"></xref> does not depend on any other choices made in the protocol extensibility points, i.e., it can be used in the Same Device Flow, too.</t>

<t>(1) The Verifier sends to the Wallet an Authorization Request that contains a Request URI from where to obtain the Request Object containing Authorization Request parameters.</t>
<t>(2) The Wallet sends an HTTP GET request to the Request URI to retrieve the Request Object.</t>
<t>(2.5) The HTTP GET response returns the Request Object containing Authorization Request parameters. It especially contains a Presentation Definition as defined in <xref target="DIF.PresentationExchange"></xref> that describes the requirements of the Credential(s) that the Verifier is requesting to be presented. Such requirements could include what type of Credential(s), in what format(s), which individual Claims within those Credential(s) (Selective Disclosure), etc. The Wallet processes the Request Object and determines what Credentials are available matching the Verifier's request.

<section anchor="scope"><name>Scope</name>
<t>OpenID for Verifiable Presentations extends existing OAuth 2.0 mechanisms as following:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>A new <tt>presentation_definition</tt> Authorization Request parameter that uses the <xref target="DIF.PresentationExchange"></xref> syntax is defined to request presentation of Verifiable Credentials in arbitrary formats. See <xref target="vp_token_request"></xref> for more details.</li>
<li>A new query language, the Digital Credentials Query Language (DCQL), is defined to enable requesting Verifiable Credentials in an easier and more flexible way. See <xref target="dcql_query"></xref> for more details.</li>
<li>A new <tt>dcql_query</tt> Authorization Request parameter is defined to request presentation of Verifiable Credentials in the JSON-encoded DCQL format. See <xref target="vp_token_request"></xref> for more details.</li>
<li>A new <tt>vp_token</tt> response parameter is defined to return Verifiable Presentations to the Verifier in either Authorization or Token Response depending on the Response Type. See <xref target="response"></xref> for more details.</li>
<li>New Response Types <tt>vp_token</tt> and <tt>vp_token id_token</tt> are defined to request Verifiable Credentials to be returned in the Authorization Response (standalone or along with a Self-Issued ID Token <xref target="SIOPv2"></xref>). See <xref target="response"></xref> for more details.</li>
<li>A new OAuth 2.0 Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> is defined to support sending the response across devices, or when the size of the response exceeds the redirect URL character size limitation. See <xref target="response_mode_post"></xref> for more details.</li>
<li>The <xref target="DIF.PresentationExchange"></xref> <tt>format</tt> parameter is used throughout the protocol in order to enable customization according to the specific needs of a particular Credential format. Examples in <xref target="format_specific_parameters"></xref> are given for Credential formats as specified in <xref target="VC_DATA"></xref>, <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref>, <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref>, and <xref target="Hyperledger.Indy"></xref>.</li>
<li>The concept of a Client Identifier Scheme to enable deployments of this specification to use different mechanisms to obtain and validate metadata of the Verifier beyond the scope of <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>.</li>
</ul>
<t>Presentation of Verifiable Credentials using OpenID for Verifiable Presentations can be combined with the End-User authentication using <xref target="SIOPv2"></xref>, and the issuance of OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="vp_token_request"><name>Authorization Request</name>
<t>The Authorization Request follows the definition given in <xref target="RFC6749"></xref> taking into account the recommendations given in <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-security-topics"></xref>.</t>
<t>The Verifier MAY send an Authorization Request as a Request Object either by value or by reference, as defined in the JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR) <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>.</t>
<t>This specification defines a new mechanism for the cases when the Wallet wants to provide to the Verifier details about its technical capabilities to
allow the Verifier to generate a request that matches the technical capabilities of that Wallet.
To enable this, the Authorization Request can contain a <tt>request_uri_method</tt> parameter with the value <tt>post</tt>
that signals to the Wallet that it can make an HTTP POST request to the Verifier's <tt>request_uri</tt>
endpoint with information about its capabilities as defined in <xref target="request_uri_method_post"></xref>. The Wallet MAY continue with JAR
when it receives <tt>request_uri_method</tt> parameter with the value <tt>post</tt> but does not support this feature.</t>
<t>The Verifier articulates requirements of the Credential(s) that are requested using <tt>presentation_definition</tt> and <tt>presentation_definition_uri</tt> parameters that contain a Presentation Definition JSON object as defined in Section 5 of <xref target="DIF.PresentationExchange"></xref>. Wallet implementations MUST process Presentation Definition JSON object and select candidate Verifiable Credential(s) using the evaluation process described in Section 8 of <xref target="DIF.PresentationExchange"></xref> unless implementing only a profile of <xref target="DIF.PresentationExchange"></xref> that provides rules on how to evaluate and process <xref target="DIF.PresentationExchange"></xref>.</t>
<t>The Verifier communicates a Client Identifier Scheme that indicate how the Wallet is supposed to interpret the Client Identifier and associated data in the process of Client identification, authentication, and authorization as a prefix in the <tt>client_id</tt> parameter. This enables deployments of this specification to use different mechanisms to obtain and validate Client metadata beyond the scope of <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>. A certain Client Identifier Scheme MAY require the Verifier to sign the Authorization Request as means of authentication and/or pass additional parameters and require the Wallet to process them.</t>
<t>Depending on the Client Identifier Scheme, the Verifier can communicate a JSON object with its metadata using the <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter which contains name/value pairs.</t>
<t>This specification enables the Verifier to send both Presentation Definition JSON object and Client Metadata JSON object by value or by reference.</t>
<t>Additional request parameters, other than those defined in this section, MAY be defined and used, as described in <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>.
The Wallet MUST ignore any unrecognized parameters, other than the <tt>transaction_data</tt> parameter.
One exception to this rule is <tt>transaction_data</tt> parameter, and the wallets that do not support this parameter MUST reject requests that contain it.</t>

<dd>A string containing a Presentation Definition JSON object. See <xref target="request_presentation_definition"></xref> for more details.</dd>
<dt><tt>presentation_definition_uri</tt>:</dt>
<dd>A string containing an HTTPS URL pointing to a resource where a Presentation Definition JSON object can be retrieved. See <xref target="request_presentation_definition_uri"></xref> for more details.</dd>
<dt><tt>dcql_query</tt>:</dt>
<dd>A string containing a JSON-encoded DCQL query as defined in <xref target="dcql_query"></xref>.</dd>
</dl>
<t>Exactly one of the following parameters MUST be present in the Authorization Request: <tt>dcql_query</tt>, <tt>presentation_definition</tt>, <tt>presentation_definition_uri</tt>, or a <tt>scope</tt> value representing a Presentation Definition.</t>

<dl>
<dt><tt>client_metadata</tt>:</dt>
<dd><t>OPTIONAL. A JSON object containing the Verifier metadata values. It MUST be UTF-8 encoded. The following metadata parameters MAY be used:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>jwks</tt>: OPTIONAL. A JWKS as defined in <xref target="RFC7591"></xref>. It MAY contain one or more public keys, such as those used by the Wallet as an input to a key agreement that may be used for encryption of the Authorization Response (see <xref target="jarm"></xref>), or where the Wallet will require the public key of the Verifier to generate the Verifiable Presentation. This allows the Verifier to pass ephemeral keys specific to this Authorization Request. Public keys included in this parameter MUST NOT be used to verify the signature of signed Authorization Requests.</li>
<li><tt>vp_formats</tt>: REQUIRED when not available to the Wallet via another mechanism. As defined in <xref target="client_metadata_parameters"></xref>.</li>
<li><tt>authorization_signed_response_alg</tt>: OPTIONAL. As defined in <xref target="JARM"></xref>.</li>
<li><tt>authorization_encrypted_response_alg</tt>: OPTIONAL. As defined in <xref target="JARM"></xref>.</li>
<li><tt>authorization_encrypted_response_enc</tt>: OPTIONAL. As defined in <xref target="JARM"></xref>.</li>
</ul>
<t>Authoritative data the Wallet is able to obtain about the Client from other sources, for example those from an OpenID Federation Entity Statement, take precedence over the values passed in <tt>client_metadata</tt>.</t>
<t>Other metadata parameters MUST be ignored unless a profile of this specification explicitly defines them as usable in the <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter.</t>
</dd>
<dt><tt>request_uri_method</tt>:</dt>
<dd><t>OPTIONAL. A string determining the HTTP method to be used when the <tt>request_uri</tt> parameter is included in the same request. Two case-sensitive valid values are defined in this specification: <tt>get</tt> and <tt>post</tt>. If <tt>request_uri_method</tt> value is <tt>get</tt>, the Wallet MUST send the request to retrieve the Request Object using the HTTP GET method, i.e., as defined in <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>. If <tt>request_uri_method</tt> value is <tt>post</tt>, a supporting Wallet MUST send the request using the HTTP POST method as detailed in <xref target="request_uri_method_post"></xref>. If the <tt>request_uri_method</tt> parameter is not present, the Wallet MUST process the <tt>request_uri</tt> parameter as defined in <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>. Wallets not supporting the <tt>post</tt> method will send a GET request to the Request URI (default behavior as defined in <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>). <tt>request_uri_method</tt> parameter MUST NOT be present if a <tt>request_uri</tt> parameter is not present.</t>
</dd>
</dl>
<t>If the Verifier set the <tt>request_uri_method</tt> parameter value to <tt>post</tt> and there is no other means to convey its capabilities to the Wallet, it SHOULD add the <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter to the Authorization Request.
This enables the Wallet to assess the Verifier's capabilities, allowing it to transmit only the relevant capabilities through the <tt>wallet_metadata</tt> parameter in the Request URI POST request.</t>

<dl>
<dt><tt>transaction_data</tt>:</dt>
<dd><t>OPTIONAL. Array of strings, where each string is a base64url encoded JSON object that contains a typed parameter set with details about the transaction that the Verifier is requesting the End-User to authorize. See <xref target="transaction_data"></xref> for details. The Wallet MUST return an error if a request contains even one unrecognized transaction data type or transaction data not conforming to the respective type definition. In addition to the parameters determined by the type of transaction data, each <tt>transaction_data</tt> object consists of the following parameters defined by this specification:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>type</tt>: REQUIRED. String that identifies the type of transaction data . This value determines parameters that can be included in the <tt>transaction_data</tt> object. The specific values are out of scope of this specification. It is RECOMMENDED to use collision-resistant names for <tt>type</tt> values.</li>
<li><tt>credential_ids</tt>: REQUIRED. Array of strings each referencing a Credential requested by the Verifier that can be used to authorize this transaction. In Presentation Exchange, the string matches the <tt>id</tt> field in the Input Descriptor. In the Digital Credentials Query Language, the string matches the <tt>id</tt> field in the Credential Query. If there is more than one element in the array, the Wallet MUST use only one of the referenced Credentials for transaction authorization.</li>
<li><tt>transaction_data_hashes_alg</tt>: OPTIONAL. Array of strings each representing a hash algorithm identifier, one of which MUST be used to calculate hashes in <tt>transaction_data_hashes</tt> response parameter. The value of the identifier MUST be a hash algorithm value from the &quot;Hash Name String&quot; column in the IANA &quot;Named Information Hash Algorithm&quot; registry <xref target="IANA.Hash.Algorithms"></xref> or a value defined in another specification and/or profile of this specification. If this parameter is not present, a default value of <tt>sha-256</tt> MUST be used. To promote interoperability, implementations MUST support the sha-256 hash algorithm.</li>
</ul></dd>
</dl>
<t>Each document specifying details of a transaction data type defines what Credential(s) can be used to authorize those transactions. Those Credential(s) can be issued specifically for the transaction authorization use case or re-use existing Credential(s) used for user identification. A mechanism for Credential Issuers to express that a particular Credential can be used for authorization of transaction data is out of scope for this specification.</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of a transaction data content, after base64url decoding one of the strings in the <tt>transaction_data</tt> parameter:</t>

<t>The following additional considerations are given for pre-existing Authorization Request parameters:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>nonce</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. Defined in <xref target="OpenID.Core"></xref>. It is used to securely bind the Verifiable Presentation(s) provided by the Wallet to the particular transaction.

Values MUST only contain ASCII URL safe characters (uppercase and lowercase letters, decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde).</dd>
<dt><tt>scope</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. Defined in <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>. The Wallet MAY allow Verifiers to request presentation of Verifiable Credentials by utilizing a pre-defined scope value. See <xref target="request_scope"></xref> for more details.</dd>
<dt><tt>response_mode</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. Defined in <xref target="OAuth.Responses"></xref>. This parameter is used (through the new Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt>) to ask the Wallet to send the response to the Verifier via an HTTPS connection (see <xref target="response_mode_post"></xref> for more details). It is also used to request signing and encrypting (see <xref target="jarm"></xref> for more details). If the parameter is not present, the default value is <tt>fragment</tt>.</dd>

<section anchor="request_scope"><name>Using <tt>scope</tt> Parameter to Request Verifiable Credential(s)</name>
<t>Wallets MAY support requesting presentation of Verifiable Credentials using OAuth 2.0 scope values.</t>
<t>Such a scope value MUST be an alias for
- a well-defined DCQL query, or
- a well-defined Presentation Definition (for Presentation Exchange) that will be referred to in the <tt>presentation_submission</tt> response parameter.</t>
<t>The specific scope values, and the mapping between a certain scope value and the respective

<t>Possible options include normative text in a separate specification defining scope values along with a description of their
semantics or machine-readable definitions in the Wallet's server metadata, mapping a scope value to an equivalent
Presentation Definition JSON object.</t>
<t>If Presentation Exchange is used, the definition of the scope value MUST allow the Verifier to determine the identifiers of the Presentation Definition and Input Descriptor(s) in the <tt>presentation_submission</tt> response parameter (<tt>definition_id</tt> and <tt>descriptor_map.id</tt> respectively) as well as the Credential formats and types in the <tt>vp_token</tt> response parameter defined in <xref target="response-parameters"></xref>.</t>

<t>When the Verifier is sending a Request Object as defined in <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>, the <tt>aud</tt> Claim value depends on whether the recipient of the request can be identified by the Verifier or not:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">

</ul>
<t>Note: &quot;<eref target="https://self-issued.me/v2&quot;">https://self-issued.me/v2"</eref> is a symbolic string and can be used as an <tt>aud</tt> Claim value even when this specification is used standalone, without SIOPv2.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="client_metadata_management"><name>Client Identifier Scheme and Verifier Metadata Management</name>
<t>This specification defines the concept of a Client Identifier Scheme that indicates how the Wallet is supposed to interpret the Client Identifier and associated data in the process of Client identification, authentication, and authorization. The Client Identifier Scheme enables deployments of this specification to use different mechanisms to obtain and validate metadata of the Verifier beyond the scope of <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>. The term Client Identifier Scheme is used since the Verifier is acting as an OAuth 2.0 Client.</t>
<t>The Client Identifier Scheme is a string that MAY be communicated by the Verifier in a prefix within the <tt>client_id</tt> parameter in the Authorization Request. A fallback to pre-registered Clients as in <xref target="RFC6749"></xref> remains in place as a default mechanism in case no Client Identifier Scheme was provided. A certain Client Identifier Scheme may require the Verifier to sign the Authorization Request as means of authentication and/or pass additional parameters and require the Wallet to process them.</t>

<section anchor="syntax"><name>Syntax</name>
<t>In the <tt>client_id</tt> Authorization Request parameter and other places where the Client Identifier is used, the Client Identifier Schemes are prefixed to the usual Client Identifier, separated by a <tt>:</tt> (colon) character:</t>

<artwork>&lt;client_id_scheme&gt;:&lt;orig_client_id&gt;
</artwork>
<t>Here, <tt>&lt;client_id_scheme&gt;</tt> is the Client Identifier Scheme and <tt>&lt;orig_client_id&gt;</tt> is an identifier for the Client within the namespace of that scheme. See <xref target="client_identifier_schemes"></xref> for Client Identifier Schemes defined by this specification.</t>
<t>Wallets MUST use the presence of a <tt>:</tt> (colon) character to determine whether a Client Identifier Scheme is used. If a <tt>:</tt> character is present, the Wallet MUST interpret the Client Identifier according to the Client Identifier Scheme, here defined as the string before the (first) <tt>:</tt> character. If the Wallet does not support the Client Identifier Scheme, the Wallet MUST refuse the request.</t>
<t>For example, an Authorization Request might contain <tt>client_id=verifier_attestation:example-client</tt> to indicate that the <tt>verifier_attestation</tt> Client Identifier Scheme is to be used and that within this scheme, the Verifier can be identified by the string <tt>example-client</tt>. The presentation would contain the full <tt>verifier_attestation:example-client</tt> string as the audience (intended receiver) and the same full string would be used as the Client Identifier anywhere in the OAuth flow.</t>
<t>Note that the Verifier needs to determine which Client Identifier Schemes the Wallet supports prior to sending the Authorization Request in order to choose a supported scheme.</t>
<t>Depending on the Client Identifier Scheme, the Verifier can communicate a JSON object with its metadata using the <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter which contains name/value pairs.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="fallback"><name>Fallback</name>
<t>If a <tt>:</tt> character is not present in the Client Identifier, the Wallet MUST treat the Client Identifier as referencing a pre-registered client. This is equivalent to the <xref target="RFC6749"></xref> default behavior, i.e., the Client Identifier needs to be known to the Wallet in advance of the Authorization Request. The Verifier metadata is obtained using <xref target="RFC7591"></xref> or through out-of-band mechanisms.</t>
<t>For example, if an Authorization Request contains <tt>client_id=example-client</tt>, the Wallet would interprete the Client Identifier as referring to a pre-registered client.</t>
<t>From this definition, it follows that pre-registered clients MUST NOT contain a <tt>:</tt> character in their Client Identifier.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security-considerations"><name>Security Considerations</name>
<t>Confusing Verifiers using a Client Identifier Scheme with those using none can lead to attacks. Therefore, Wallets MUST always use the full Client Identifier, including the prefix if provided, within the context of the Wallet or its responses to identify the client. This refers in particular to places where the Client Identifier is used in <xref target="RFC6749"></xref> and in the presentation returned to the Verifier.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="client_identifier_schemes"><name>Defined Client Identifier Schemes</name>
<t>This specification defines the following Client Identifier Schemes, followed by the examples where applicable:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>redirect_uri</tt>: This value indicates that the Client Identifier (without the prefix <tt>redirect_uri:</tt>) is the Verifier's Redirect URI (or Response URI when Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> is used). The Authorization Request MUST NOT be signed. The Verifier MAY omit the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> Authorization Request parameter (or <tt>response_uri</tt> when Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> is used). All Verifier metadata parameters MUST be passed using the <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter defined in <xref target="new_parameters"></xref>. Example Client Identifier value is <tt>redirect_uri:https://client.example.org/cb</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of a request with this Client Identifier Scheme:</t>

<artwork>HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://wallet.example.org/universal-link?
  response_type=vp_token
  &amp;client_id=redirect_uri%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb

</artwork>

<ul>
<li><t><tt>https</tt>: This value indicates that the Client Identifier is an Entity Identifier defined in OpenID Federation <xref target="OpenID.Federation"></xref>. Since the Entity Identifier is already defined to start with <tt>https:</tt>, this Client Identifier Scheme MUST NOT be prefixed additionally. Processing rules given in <xref target="OpenID.Federation"></xref> MUST be followed. Automatic Registration as defined in <xref target="OpenID.Federation"></xref> MUST be used. The Authorization Request MAY also contain a <tt>trust_chain</tt> parameter. The final Verifier metadata is obtained from the Trust Chain after applying the policies, according to <xref target="OpenID.Federation"></xref>. The <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter, if present in the Authorization Request, MUST be ignored when this Client Identifier scheme is used. Example Client Identifier: <tt>https://federation-verifier.example.com</tt>.</t>
</li>
<li><t><tt>did</tt>: This value indicates that the Client Identifier is a DID defined in <xref target="DID-Core"></xref>. Since the DID URI is already defined to start with <tt>did:</tt>, this Client Identifier Scheme MUST NOT be prefixed additionally. The request MUST be signed with a private key associated with the DID. A public key to verify the signature MUST be obtained from the <tt>verificationMethod</tt> property of a DID Document. Since DID Document may include multiple public keys, a particular public key used to sign the request in question MUST be identified by the <tt>kid</tt> in the JOSE Header. To obtain the DID Document, the Wallet MUST use DID Resolution defined by the DID method used by the Verifier. All Verifier metadata other than the public key MUST be obtained from the <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter as defined in <xref target="new_parameters"></xref>. Example Client Identifier: <tt>did:example:123#1</tt>.</t>
</li>
</ul>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of a header and a body of a signed Request Object when Client Identifier scheme is a <tt>did</tt>:</t>

    }
  }
}
</sourcecode>

<ul>
<li><t><tt>verifier_attestation</tt>: This Client Identifier Scheme allows the Verifier to authenticate using a JWT that is bound to a certain public key as defined in <xref target="verifier_attestation_jwt"></xref>. When the Client Identifier Scheme is <tt>verifier_attestation</tt>, the Client Identifier MUST equal the <tt>sub</tt> claim value in the Verifier attestation JWT. The request MUST be signed with the private key corresponding to the public key in the <tt>cnf</tt> claim in the Verifier attestation JWT. This serves as proof of possesion of this key. The Verifier attestation JWT MUST be added to the <tt>jwt</tt> JOSE Header of the request object (see <xref target="verifier_attestation_jwt"></xref>). The Wallet MUST validate the signature on the Verifier attestation JWT. The <tt>iss</tt> claim value of the Verifier Attestation JWT MUST identify a party the Wallet trusts for issuing Verifier Attestation JWTs. If the Wallet cannot establish trust, it MUST refuse the request. If the issuer of the Verifier Attestation JWT adds a <tt>redirect_uris</tt> claim to the attestation, the Wallet MUST ensure the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> request parameter value exactly matches one of the <tt>redirect_uris</tt> claim entries. All Verifier metadata other than the public key MUST be obtained from the <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter. Example Client Identifier: <tt>verifier_attestation:verifier.example</tt>.</t>
</li>
<li><t><tt>x509_san_dns</tt>: When the Client Identifier Scheme is <tt>x509_san_dns</tt>, the Client Identifier MUST be a DNS name and match a <tt>dNSName</tt> Subject Alternative Name (SAN) <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> entry in the leaf certificate passed with the request. The request MUST be signed with the private key corresponding to the public key in the leaf X.509 certificate of the certificate chain added to the request in the <tt>x5c</tt> JOSE header <xref target="RFC7515"></xref> of the signed request object. The Wallet MUST validate the signature and the trust chain of the X.509 certificate. All Verifier metadata other than the public key MUST be obtained from the <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter. If the Wallet can establish trust in the Client Identifier authenticated through the certificate, e.g. because the Client Identifier is contained in a list of trusted Client Identifiers, it may allow the client to freely choose the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> value. If not, the FQDN of the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> value MUST match the Client Identifier without the prefix <tt>x509_san_dns:</tt>. Example Client Identifier: <tt>x509_san_dns:client.example.org</tt>.</t>
</li>
<li><t><tt>x509_san_uri</tt>: When the Client Identifier Scheme is <tt>x509_san_uri</tt>, the Client Identifier MUST be a URI and match a <tt>uniformResourceIdentifier</tt> Subject Alternative Name (SAN) <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> entry in the leaf certificate passed with the request. The request MUST be signed with the private key corresponding to the public key in the leaf X.509 certificate of the certificate chain added to the request in the <tt>x5c</tt> JOSE header <xref target="RFC7515"></xref> of the signed request object. The Wallet MUST validate the signature and the trust chain of the X.509 certificate. All Verifier metadata other than the public key MUST be obtained from the <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter. If the Wallet can establish trust in the Client Identifier authenticated through the certificate, e.g., because the Client Identifier is contained in a list of trusted Client Identifiers, it may allow the client to freely choose the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> value. If not, the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> value MUST match the Client Identifier without the prefix <tt>x509_san_uri:</tt>. Example Client Identifier: <tt>x509_san_uri:https://client.example.org/cb</tt>.</t>
</li>
<li><t><tt>web-origin</tt>: This Client Identifier Scheme is defined in <xref target="dc_api_request"></xref>. It MUST NOT be used in the Authorization Request.</t>
</li>
</ul>
<t>To use the Client Identifier Schemes <tt>https</tt>, <tt>did</tt>, <tt>verifier_attestation</tt>, <tt>x509_san_dns</tt>, and <tt>x509_san_uri</tt>, Verifiers MUST be confidential clients. This might require changes to the technical design of native apps as such apps are typically public clients.</t>
<t>Other specifications can define further Client Identifier Schemes. It is RECOMMENDED to use collision-resistant names for such values.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="request_uri_method_post"><name>Request URI Method <tt>post</tt></name>
<t>This request is handled by the Request URI endpoint of the Verifier.</t>
<t>The request MUST use the HTTP POST method with the <tt>https</tt> scheme, and the content type <tt>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</tt> and the accept header set to <tt>application/oauth-authz-req+jwt</tt>. The names and values in the body MUST be encoded using UTF-8.</t>
<t>The following parameters are defined to be included in the request to the Request URI Endpoint:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>wallet_metadata</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. A String containing a JSON object containing metadata parameters as defined in <xref target="as_metadata_parameters"></xref>.</dd>
<dt><tt>wallet_nonce</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. A String value used to mitigate replay attacks of the Authorization Request. When received, the Verifier MUST use it as the <tt>wallet_nonce</tt> value in the signed authorization request object. Value can be a base64url-encoded, fresh, cryptographically random number with sufficient entropy.<br />
</dd>
</dl>
<t>If the Wallet requires the Verifier to encrypt the Request Object, it SHOULD use the <tt>jwks</tt> or <tt>jwks_uri</tt> parameter within the <tt>wallet_metadata</tt> parameter to pass the public key for the input to the key agreement. Other mechanisms to pass the encryption key can be used as well. If the Wallet requires an encrypted Authorization Response, it SHOULD specify supported encryption algorithms using the <tt>authorization_encryption_alg_values_supported</tt> and <tt>authorization_encryption_enc_values_supported</tt> parameters.</t>
<t>Additionally, if the Client Identifier Scheme permits signed Request Objects, the Wallet SHOULD list supported cryptographic algorithms for securing the Request Object through the <tt>request_object_signing_alg_values_supported</tt> parameter. Conversely, the Wallet MUST NOT include this parameter if the Client Identifier Scheme precludes signed Request Objects.</t>
<t>Additional  parameters MAY be defined and used in the request to the Request URI Endpoint.
The Verifier MUST ignore any unrecognized parameters.</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of a request:</t>

<artwork>POST /request HTTP/1.1

</artwork>

<section anchor="request-uri-response"><name>Request URI Response</name>
<t>The Request URI response MUST be an HTTP response with the content type &quot;application/oauth-authz-req+jwt&quot; and the body being a signed, optionally encrypted, request object as defined in <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>. The request object MUST fulfill the requirements as defined in <xref target="vp_token_request"></xref>.</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of a request object:</t>

<sourcecode type="json">{
  &quot;client_id&quot;: &quot;x509_san_dns:client.example.org&quot;,
  &quot;response_uri&quot;: &quot;https://client.example.org/post&quot;,

  &quot;state&quot; : &quot;eyJhb...6-sVA&quot;
}
</sourcecode>
<t>The Wallet MUST process the request as defined in <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>. Additionally, if the Wallet passed a <tt>wallet_nonce</tt> in the POST request, the Wallet MUST validate whether the request object contains the respective nonce value in a <tt>wallet_nonce</tt> claim. If it does not, the Wallet MUST terminate request processing.</t>
<t>The Wallet MUST extract the set of Authorization Request parameters from the Request Object. The Wallet MUST only use the parameters in this Request Object, even if the same parameter was provided in an Authorization Request query parameter. The Client Identifier value in the <tt>client_id</tt> Authorization Request parameter and the Request Object <tt>client_id</tt> claim value MUST be identical, including the Client Identifier Scheme. If any of these conditions are not met, the Wallet MUST terminate request processing.</t>
<t>The Wallet then validates the request as specified in OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="request-uri-error-response"><name>Request URI Error Response</name>
<t>If the Verifier responds with any HTTP error response, the Wallet MUST terminate the process.</t>
</section>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="dcql_query"><name>Digital Credentials Query Language (DCQL)</name>
<t>The Digital Credentials Query Language (DCQL, pronounced [ˈdakl̩]) is a
JSON-encoded query language that allows the Verifier to request Verifiable
Presentations that match the query. The Verifier MAY encode constraints on the
combinations of credentials and claims that are requested. The Wallet evaluates
the query against the Verifiable Credentials it holds and returns Verifiable
Presentations matching the query.</t>
<t>A valid DCQL query is defined as a JSON-encoded object with the following
top-level properties:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>credentials</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. A non-empty array of Credential Queries as defined in <xref target="credential_query"></xref>
that specify the requested Verifiable Credentials.</dd>
<dt><tt>credential_sets</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. A non-empty array of credential set queries as defined in <xref target="credential_set_query"></xref>
that specifies additional constraints on which of the requested Verifiable Credentials to return.</dd>
</dl>
<t>Note: Future extensions may define additional properties both on the top level
and in the rest of the DCQL data structure. Implementations MUST ignore any
unknown properties.</t>

<section anchor="credential_query"><name>Credential Query</name>
<t>A Credential Query is an object representing a request for a presentation of one
Credential.</t>
<t>Each entry in <tt>credentials</tt> MUST be an object with the following properties:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>id</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. A string identifying the Credential in the response and, if provided,
the constraints in <tt>credential_sets</tt>. The value MUST be a non-empty string
consisting of alphanumeric, underscore (<tt>_</tt>) or hyphen (<tt>-</tt>) characters.
Within the Authorization Request, the same <tt>id</tt> MUST NOT
be present more than once.</dd>
<dt><tt>format</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. A string that specifies the format of the requested
Verifiable Credential. Valid Credential Format Identifier values are defined in
<xref target="format_specific_parameters"></xref>.</dd>
<dt><tt>meta</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. An object defining additional properties requested by the Verifier that
apply to the metadata and validity data of the Credential. The properties of
this object are defined per Credential Format. Examples of those are in <xref target="sd_jwt_vc_meta_parameter"></xref> and <xref target="mdocs_meta_parameter"></xref>. If omitted,
no specific constraints are placed on the metadata or validity of the requested
Credential.</dd>
<dt><tt>claims</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. A non-empty array of objects as defined in <xref target="claims_query"></xref> that specifies
claims in the requested Credential.</dd>
<dt><tt>claim_sets</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. A non-empty array containing arrays of identifiers for
elements in <tt>claims</tt> that specifies which combinations of <tt>claims</tt> for the Credential are requested.
The rules for selecting claims to send are defined in <xref target="selecting_claims"></xref>.</dd>
</dl>
<t>Note that multiple Credential Queries in a request MAY request a presentation of the same Credential.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="credential_set_query"><name>Credential Set Query</name>
<t>A Credential Set Query is an object representing a request for one or more credentials to satisfy
a particular use case with the Verifier.</t>
<t>Each entry in <tt>credential_sets</tt> MUST be an object with the following properties:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>options</tt></dt>
<dd>REQUIRED: A non-empty array, where each value in the array is a list
of Credential Query identifiers representing one set of Credentials that
satisfies the use case. The value of each element in the <tt>options</tt> array is an
array of identifiers which reference elements in <tt>credentials</tt>.</dd>
<dt><tt>required</tt></dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. A boolean which indicates whether this set of Credentials is required
to satisfy the particular use case at the Verifier. If omitted, the default value is <tt>true</tt>.</dd>
<dt><tt>purpose</tt></dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. A string, number or object specifying the purpose of the
query. This specification does not define a specific structure or specific values
for this property. The purpose is intended to be used by the Verifier to
communicate the reason for the query to the Wallet. The Wallet MAY use this
information to show the user the reason for the request.</dd>
</dl>
</section>

<section anchor="claims_query"><name>Claims Query</name>
<t>Each entry in <tt>claims</tt> MUST be an object with the following properties:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>id</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED if <tt>claim_sets</tt> is present in the Credential Query; OPTIONAL otherwise. A string
identifying the particular claim. The value MUST be a non-empty string
consisting of alphanumeric, underscore (<tt>_</tt>) or hyphen (<tt>-</tt>) characters.
Within the particular <tt>claims</tt> array, the same <tt>id</tt> MUST NOT
be present more than once.</dd>
<dt><tt>path</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED if the Credential Format uses a JSON-based claims structure (e.g., IETF SD-JWT VC and W3C Verifiable Credentials); MUST NOT
be present otherwise. The value MUST be a non-empty array representing a claims path pointer that specifies the path to a claim
within the Verifiable Credential, as defined in <xref target="claims_path_pointer"></xref>.</dd>
<dt><tt>values</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. An array of strings, integers or boolean values that specifies the expected values of the claim.
If the <tt>values</tt> property is present, the Wallet SHOULD return the claim only if the
type and value of the claim both match for at least one of the elements in the array. Details of the processing rules are defined in <xref target="selecting_claims"></xref>.</dd>
</dl>
<t>The ISO mdoc specific parameters to be used in the Claims Query are defined in <xref target="mdocs_claims_query"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="dcql_query_lang_processing_rules"><name>Selecting Claims and Credentials</name>
<t>The following section describes the logic that applies for selecting claims
and for selecting credentials.</t>

<section anchor="selecting_claims"><name>Selecting Claims</name>
<t>The following rules apply for selecting claims via <tt>claims</tt> and <tt>claim_sets</tt>:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>If <tt>claims</tt> is absent, the Verifier requests all claims existing
in the Credential.</li>
<li>If <tt>claims</tt> is present, but <tt>claim_sets</tt> is absent,
the Verifier requests all claims listed in <tt>claims</tt>.</li>
<li>If both <tt>claims</tt> and <tt>claim_sets</tt> are present, the Verifier requests one combination of the claims listed in
<tt>claim_sets</tt>. The order of the options conveyed in the <tt>claim_sets</tt>
array expresses the Verifier's preference for what is returned; the Wallet MUST return
the first option that it can satisfy. If the Wallet cannot satisfy any of the
options, it MUST NOT return any claims.</li>
</ul>
<t>When a Claims Query contains a restriction on the values of a claim, the Wallet
SHOULD NOT return the claim if its value does not match at least one of the
elements in <tt>values</tt> i.e., the claim should be treated the same as if it did not
exist in the Credential. Implementing this restriction may not be possible in
all cases, for example, if the Wallet does not have access to the claim value
before presentation or user consent or if another component routing
the request to the Wallet does not have access to the claim value. Therefore, Verifiers
must treat restrictions expressed using <tt>values</tt> as a best-effort way to improve
user privacy, but MUST NOT rely on it for security checks.</t>
<t>The purpose of the <tt>claim_sets</tt> syntax is to provide a way for a verifier to
describe alternative ways a given credential can satisfy the request. The array
ordering expresses the Verifier's preference for how to fulfill the request. The
first element in the array is the most preferred and the last element in the
array is the least preferred. Verifiers SHOULD use the principle of least
information disclosure to influence how they order these options. For example, a
proof of age request should prioritize requesting an attribute like
<tt>age_over_18</tt> over an attribute like <tt>birth_date</tt>. The <tt>claim_sets</tt> syntax is
not intended to define options the user can choose from, see <xref target="dcql_query_ui"></xref> for
more information.</t>
<t>If the Wallet cannot deliver all claims requested by the Verifier
according to these rules, it MUST NOT return the respective Credential.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="selecting-credentials"><name>Selecting Credentials</name>
<t>The following rules apply for selecting Credentials via <tt>credentials</tt> and <tt>credential_sets</tt>:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>If <tt>credential_sets</tt> is not provided, the Verifier requests presentations for all
Credentials in <tt>credentials</tt> to be returned.</li>
<li><t>Otherwise, the Verifier requests presentations of Credentials to be returned satisfying</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>all of the Credential Set Queries in the <tt>credential_sets</tt> array where the <tt>required</tt> attribute is true or omitted, and</li>
<li>optionally, any of the other Credential Set Queries.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<t>To satisfy a Credential Set Query, the Wallet MUST return presentations of a
set of Credentials that match to one of the <tt>options</tt> inside the
Credential Set Query.</t>
<t>Credentials not matching the respective constraints expressed within
<tt>credentials</tt> MUST NOT be returned, i.e., they are treated as if
they would not exist in the Wallet.</t>
<t>If the Wallet cannot deliver all non-optional Credentials requested by the
Verifier according to these rules, it MUST NOT return any Credential(s).</t>
</section>

<section anchor="dcql_query_ui"><name>User Interface Considerations</name>
<t>While this specification provides the mechanisms for requesting different sets
of claims and Credentials, it does not define details about the user interface
of the Wallet, for example, if and how users can select which combination of
Credentials to present. However, it is typically expected that the Wallet
presents the End-User with a choice of which Credential(s) to present if
multiple of the sets of Credentials in <tt>options</tt> can satisfy the request.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="dcql_query_security"><name>Security Considerations</name>
<t>While the Verifier can specify various constraints both on the claims level and
the Credential level as shown above, it MUST NOT rely on the Wallet to enforce
these constraints. The Wallet is not controlled by the Verifier and the Verifier
MUST perform its own security checks on the returned Credentials and
presentations.</t>
</section>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="claims_path_pointer"><name>Claims Path Pointer</name>
<t>A claims path pointer is a pointer into the JSON structure of the Verifiable
Credential, identifying one or more claims. A claims path pointer MUST be a
non-empty array of strings and non-negative integers. A string value
indicates that the respective key is to be selected, a null value
indicates that all elements of the currently selected array(s) are to be selected;
and a non-negative integer indicates that the respective index in an array is to be selected. The path
is formed as follows:</t>
<t>Start with an empty array and repeat the following until the full path is formed.</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>To address a particular claim within an object, append the key (claim name)
to the array.</li>
<li>To address an element within an array, append the index to the array (as a
non-negative, 0-based integer).</li>
<li>To address all elements within an array, append a null value to the array.</li>
</ul>
<t>Verifiers MUST NOT point to the same claim more than once in a single query.
Wallets SHOULD ignore such duplicate claim queries.</t>

<section anchor="processing"><name>Processing</name>
<t>In detail, the array is processed by the Wallet from left to right as follows:</t>

<ol spacing="compact">
<li>Select the root element of the Credential, i.e., the top-level JSON object.</li>
<li><t>Process the query of the claims path pointer array from left to right:</t>

<ol spacing="compact">
<li>If the component is a string, select the element in the respective
key in the currently selected element(s). If any of the currently
selected element(s) is not an object, abort processing and return an
error. If the key does not exist in any element currently selected,
remove that element from the selection.</li>
<li>If the component is null, select all elements of the currently
selected array(s). If any of the currently selected element(s) is not an
array, abort processing and return an error.</li>
<li>If the component is a non-negative integer, select the element at
the respective index in the currently selected array(s). If any of the
currently selected element(s) is not an array, abort processing and
return an error. If the index does not exist in a selected array, remove
that array from the selection.</li>
<li>If the set of elements currently selected is empty, abort processing and
return an error.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<t>The result of the processing is the set of elements which is requested for
presentation.</t>

<t>A VP Token is only returned if the corresponding Authorization Request contained a <tt>dcql_query</tt> parameter, a <tt>presentation_definition</tt> parameter, a <tt>presentation_definition_uri</tt> parameter, or a <tt>scope</tt> parameter representing a Presentation Definition <xref target="vp_token_request"></xref>.</t>
<t>A VP Token can be returned in the Authorization Response or the Token Response depending on the Response Type used. See <xref target="response_type_vp_token"></xref> for more details.</t>
<t>If the Response Type value is <tt>vp_token</tt>, the VP Token is returned in the Authorization Response. When the Response Type value is <tt>vp_token id_token</tt> and the <tt>scope</tt> parameter contains <tt>openid</tt>, the VP Token is returned in the Authorization Response alongside a Self-Issued ID Token as defined in <xref target="SIOPv2"></xref>.</t>
<t>If the Response Type value is <tt>code</tt> (Authorization Code Grant Type), the VP Token is provided in the Token Response.</t>
<t>The expected behavior is summarized in the following table:</t>

<section anchor="response-parameters"><name>Response Parameters</name>
<t>When a VP Token is returned, the respective response includes the following parameters:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>vp_token</tt>:</dt>
<dd><t>REQUIRED. The structure of this parameter depends on the query language used to request the presentations in the Authorization Request:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>If DCQL was used, this is a JSON-encoded object; the keys are the <tt>id</tt> values used for the Credential Queries in the DCQL query, and the values are the Verifiable Presentations that match the respective Credential Query. The Verifiable Presentations are represented as strings or objects depending on the format as defined in <xref target="format_specific_parameters"></xref>. The same rules as above apply for encoding the Verifiable Presentations.</li>
<li>In case Presentation Exchange was used, it is a JSON String or JSON object that MUST contain a single Verifiable Presentation or an array of JSON Strings and JSON objects each of them containing a Verifiable Presentations. Each Verifiable Presentation MUST be represented as a JSON string (that is a base64url-encoded value) or a JSON object depending on a format as defined in <xref target="format_specific_parameters"></xref>.  When a single Verifiable Presentation is returned, the array syntax MUST NOT be used.  If <xref target="format_specific_parameters"></xref> defines a rule for encoding the respective Credential format in the Credential Response, this rules MUST also be followed when encoding Credentials of this format in the <tt>vp_token</tt> response parameter. Otherwise, this specification does not require any additional encoding when a Credential format is already represented as a JSON object or a JSON string.</li>
</ul></dd>
<dt><tt>presentation_submission</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED if Presentation Exchange was used for the request; MUST NOT be used otherwise. The <tt>presentation_submission</tt> element as defined in <xref target="DIF.PresentationExchange"></xref>. It contains mappings between the requested Verifiable Credentials and where to find them within the returned VP Token. This is expressed via elements in the <tt>descriptor_map</tt> array, known as Input Descriptor Mapping Objects. These objects contain a field called <tt>path</tt>, which, for this specification, MUST have the value <tt>$</tt> (top level root path) when only one Verifiable Presentation is contained in the VP Token, and MUST have the value <tt>$[n]</tt> (indexed path from root) when there are multiple Verifiable Presentations, where <tt>n</tt> is the index to select. Additional parameters can be defined by Credential Formats, see <xref target="format_specific_parameters"></xref> for details.</dd>
</dl>
<t>Other parameters, such as <tt>state</tt> or <tt>code</tt> (from <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>), or <tt>id_token</tt> (from <xref target="OpenID.Core"></xref>), and <tt>iss</tt> (from <xref target="RFC9207"></xref>) can be included in the response as defined in the respective specifications. <tt>state</tt> values MUST only contain ASCII URL safe characters (uppercase and lowercase letters, decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde). For the implementation considerations of a <tt>state</tt> parameter, see <xref target="state_management"></xref>.</t>
<t>If Presentation Exchange was used for the request, the <tt>presentation_submission</tt> element MUST be included as a separate response parameter alongside the VP token. Clients MUST ignore any <tt>presentation_submission</tt> element included inside a Verifiable Presentation.</t>
<t>Including the <tt>presentation_submission</tt> parameter as a separate response parameter allows the Wallet to provide the Verifier with additional information about the format and structure in advance of the processing of the VP Token, and can be used even with the Credential formats that do not allow for the direct inclusion of <tt>presentation_submission</tt> parameters inside a Credential itself.</t>
<t>Additional response parameters MAY be defined and used,
as described in <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>.
The Client MUST ignore any unrecognized parameters.</t>

<section anchor="response_mode_post"><name>Response Mode &quot;direct_post&quot;</name>
<t>The Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> allows the Wallet to send the Authorization Response to an endpoint controlled by the Verifier via an HTTP POST request.</t>
<t>It has been defined to address the following use cases:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Verifier and Wallet are located on different devices; thus, the Wallet cannot send the Authorization Response to the Verifier using a redirect.</li>
<li>The Authorization Response size exceeds the URL length limits of user agents, so flows relying only on redirects (such as Response Mode <tt>fragment</tt>) cannot be used. In those cases, the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> is the way to convey the Verifiable Presentations to the Verifier without the need for the Wallet to have a backend.</li>
</ul>
<t>The Response Mode is defined in accordance with <xref target="OAuth.Responses"></xref> as follows:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>direct_post</tt>:</dt>
<dd>In this mode, the Authorization Response is sent to the Verifier using an HTTP POST request to an endpoint controlled by the Verifier. The Authorization Response MUST be encoded in the request body using the format defined by the <tt>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</tt> HTTP content type. The parameters in the request body MUST all be encoded using UTF-8. The verifier can request that the wallet redirects the user to the verifier using the response as defined below.</dd>
</dl>
<t>The following new Authorization Request parameter is defined to be used in conjunction with Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt>:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>response_uri</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED when the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> is used. The URL to which the Wallet MUST send the Authorization Response using an HTTP POST request as defined by the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt>. The Response URI receives all Authorization Response parameters as defined by the respective Response Type. When the <tt>response_uri</tt> parameter is present, the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> Authorization Request parameter MUST NOT be present. If the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> Authorization Request parameter is present when the Response Mode is <tt>direct_post</tt>, the Wallet MUST return an <tt>invalid_request</tt> Authorization Response error. The <tt>response_uri</tt> value MUST be a value that the client would be permitted to use as <tt>redirect_uri</tt> when following the rules defined in <xref target="client_metadata_management"></xref>.</dd>
</dl>
<t>Note: When the specification text refers to the usage of Redirect URI in the Authorization Request, that part of the text also applies when Response URI is used in the Authorization Request with Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt>.</t>
<t>Note: The Verifier's component providing the user interface (Frontend) and the Verifier's component providing the Response URI need to be able to map authorization requests to the respective authorization responses. The Verifier MAY use the <tt>state</tt> Authorization Request parameter to add appropriate data to the Authorization Response for that purpose, for details see <xref target="implementation_considerations_direct_post"></xref>.</t>
<t>Additional request parameters MAY be defined and used with the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt>.
The Wallet MUST ignore any unrecognized parameters.</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of the payload of a Request Object with Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt>:</t>

<sourcecode type="json">{
  &quot;client_id&quot;: &quot;redirect_uri:https://client.example.org/post&quot;,

<t>The following non-normative example of an Authorization Request refers to the Authorization Request Object from above through the <tt>request_uri</tt> parameter. The Authorization Request can be displayed to the End-User either directly (as a link) or as a QR Code:</t>

<t>The following is a non-normative example of the Authorization Response that is sent via an HTTP POST request to the Verifier's Response URI:</t>

<artwork>POST /post HTTP/1.1

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

  error=invalid_request&amp;
  error_description=unsupported%20client_id_scheme&amp;
  state=eyJhb...6-sVA
</artwork>
<t>If the Response URI has successfully processed the Authorization Response or Authorization Error Response, it MUST respond with an HTTP status code of 200 with <tt>Content-Type</tt> of <tt>application/json</tt> and a JSON object in the response body.</t>
<t>The following new parameter is defined for use in the JSON object returned from the Response Endpoint to the Wallet:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>redirect_uri</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. String containing a URI. When this parameter is present the Wallet MUST redirect the user agent to this URI. This allows the Verifier to continue the interaction with the End-User on the device where the Wallet resides after the Wallet has sent the Authorization Response to the Response URI. It can be used by the Verifier to prevent session fixation (<xref target="session_fixation"></xref>) attacks. The Response URI MAY return the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> parameter in response to successful Authorization Responses or for Error Responses.</dd>
</dl>
<t>Additional response parameters MAY be defined and used. The Wallet MUST ignore any unrecognized parameters.</t>
<t>Note: Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> without the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> could be less secure than Response Modes with redirects. For details, see (<xref target="session_fixation"></xref>).</t>
<t>The value of the redirect URI is an absolute URI as defined by <xref target="RFC3986"></xref> Section 4.3 and is chosen by the Verifier. The Verifier MUST include a fresh, cryptographically random value in the URL. This value is used to ensure only the receiver of the redirect can fetch and process the Authorization Response. The value can be added as a path component, as a fragment or as a parameter to the URL. It is RECOMMENDED to use a cryptographic random value of 128 bits or more. For implementation considerations see <xref target="implementation_considerations_direct_post"></xref>.</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of the response from the Verifier to the Wallet upon receiving the Authorization Response at the Response URI (using a <tt>response_code</tt> parameter from <xref target="implementation_considerations_direct_post"></xref>):</t>

}
</artwork>
<t>If the response does not contain the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> parameter, the Wallet is not required to perform any further steps.</t>
<t>Note: In the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> or <tt>direct_post.jwt</tt>, the Wallet can change the UI based on the Verifier's callback to the Wallet following the submission of the Authorization Response.</t>
<t>Additional parameters MAY be defined and used in the response from the Response Endpoint to the Wallet.
The Wallet MUST ignore any unrecognized parameters.</t>

<section anchor="jarm"><name>Signed and/or Encrypted Responses</name>
<t>This section defines how an Authorization Response containing a VP Token can be signed and/or encrypted at the application level when the Response Type value is <tt>vp_token</tt> or <tt>vp_token id_token</tt>. Encrypting the Authorization Response can prevent personal data in the Authorization Response from leaking, when the Authorization Response is returned through the front channel (e.g., the browser).</t>
<t>To sign, encrypt, or both sign and encrypt the Authorization Response, implementations MUST use the JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode for OAuth 2.0 (JARM) <xref target="JARM"></xref>, and when only encrypting, the JARM extension described below.</t>
<t>This specification also defines how to encrypt an unsigned Authorization Response by extending the mechanisms defined in <xref target="JARM"></xref>. The JSON containing the Authorization Response parameters can be encrypted as the payload of the JWE.</t>
<t>The advantage of an encrypted but not signed Authorization Response is that it prevents the signing key from being used as a correlation factor. It can also be a challenge to establish trust in the signing key to ensure authenticity. For security considerations with encrypted but unsigned responses, see <xref target="encrypting_unsigned_response"></xref>.</t>
<t>If the JWT is only a JWE, the following processing rules MUST be followed:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>iss</tt>, <tt>exp</tt> and <tt>aud</tt> MUST be omitted in the JWT Claims Set of the JWE, and the processing rules as per <xref target="JARM"></xref> Section 2.4 related to these claims do not apply.</li>
<li>The processing rules as per <xref target="JARM"></xref> Section 2.4 related to JWS processing MUST be ignored.</li>
</ul>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of the payload of a JWT used in an Authorization Response that is encrypted and not signed:</t>

</sourcecode>
<t>The JWT response document MUST include the <tt>vp_token</tt> and, if Presentation Exchange was used in the request, the <tt>presentation_submission</tt> parameters as defined in <xref target="response-parameters"></xref>.</t>
<t>The key material used for encryption and signing SHOULD be determined using existing metadata mechanisms.</t>
<t>To obtain Verifier's public key for the input to the key agreement to encrypt the Authorization Response, the Wallet MUST use <tt>jwks</tt> claim within the <tt>client_metadata</tt> request parameter, or within the metadata defined in the Entity Configuration when <xref target="OpenID.Federation"></xref> is used, or other mechanisms.</t>
<t>To sign the Authorization Response, the Wallet MUST use a private key that corresponds to a public key made available in its metadata.</t>
<t>Note: For encryption, implementers have a variety of options available through JOSE, including the use of Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) as detailed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-jose-hpke-encrypt"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="direct_post_jwt"><name>Response Mode &quot;direct_post.jwt&quot;</name>
<t>This specification also defines a new Response Mode <tt>direct_post.jwt</tt>, which allows for JARM to be used with Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> defined in <xref target="response_mode_post"></xref>.</t>
<t>The Response Mode <tt>direct_post.jwt</tt> causes the Wallet to send the Authorization Response using an HTTP POST request instead of redirecting back to the Verifier as defined in <xref target="response_mode_post"></xref>. The Wallet adds the <tt>response</tt> parameter containing the JWT as defined in Section 4.1. of <xref target="JARM"></xref> and <xref target="jarm"></xref> in the body of an HTTP POST request using the <tt>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</tt> content type.

<section anchor="verifier_attestation_jwt"><name>Verifier Attestation JWT</name>
<t>The Verifier Attestation JWT is a JWT especially designed to allow a Wallet to authenticate a Verifier in a secure and flexible manner. A Verifier Attestation JWT is issued to the Verifier by a party that wallets trust for the purpose of authentication and authorization of Verifiers. The way this trust established is out of scope of this specification. Every Verifier is bound to a public key, the Verifier MUST always present a Verifier Attestation JWT along with the proof of possession for this key. In the case of the Client Identifier Scheme <tt>verifier_attestation</tt>, the authorization request is signed with this key, which serves as proof of possession.</t>
<t>A Verifier Attestation JWT MUST contain the following claims:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>iss</tt>: REQUIRED. This claim identifies the issuer of the Verifier Attestation JWT. The <tt>iss</tt> value MAY be used to retrieve the issuer's public key. How the trust is established between Wallet and Issuer and how the public key is obtained for validating the attestation's signature is out of scope of this specification.</li>
<li><tt>sub</tt>: REQUIRED. The value of this claim MUST be the <tt>client_id</tt> of the client making the credential request.</li>
<li><tt>iat</tt>: OPTIONAL. (number). The value of this claim MUST be the time at which the Verifier Attestation JWT was issued using the syntax defined in [RFC7519].</li>
<li><tt>exp</tt>: REQUIRED. (number). The value of this claim MUST be the time at which the Verifier Attestation JWT expires using the syntax defined in [RFC7519]. The Wallet MUST reject any Verifier Attestation JWT with an expiration time that has passed, subject to allowable clock skew between systems.</li>
<li><tt>nbf</tt>: OPTIONAL. The Verifier Attestation JWT MAY contain an &quot;nbf&quot; (not before) claim that identifies the time before which the token MUST NOT be accepted for processing.</li>
<li><tt>cnf</tt>: REQUIRED. This claim contains the confirmation method as defined in <xref target="RFC7800"></xref>. It MUST contain a JSON Web Key <xref target="RFC7517"></xref> as defined in Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC7800"></xref>. This claim determines the public key for which's corresponding private key the Verifier MUST proof possession of when presenting the Verifier Attestation JWT. This additional security measure allows the Verifier to obtain a Verifier Attestation JWT from a trusted issuer and use it for a long time independent of that issuer without the risk of an adversary impersonating the Verifier by replaying a captured attestation.</li>
</ul>
<t>Additional claims MAY be defined and used in the Verifier Attestation JWT,
as described in <xref target="RFC7519"></xref>.
The Wallet MUST ignore any unrecognized claims.</t>
<t>Verifier Attestation JWTs compliant with this specification MUST use the media type <tt>application/verifier-attestation+jwt</tt> as defined in <xref target="va_media_type"></xref>.</t>
<t>A Verifier Attestation JWT MUST set the <tt>typ</tt> JOSE header to <tt>verifier-attestation+jwt</tt>.</t>
<t>The Verifier Attestation JWT MAY be conveyed in the header of a JWS signed object (JOSE header).</t>
<t>This specification introduces a JOSE header, which can be used to add a JWT to such a header as follows:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>jwt</tt>: This JOSE header MUST contain a JWT.</li>
</ul>
<t>In the context of this specification, such a JWT MUST set the <tt>typ</tt> JOSE header to <tt>verifier-attestation+jwt</tt>.</t>

<t>(1) The Verifier produces a <tt>nonce</tt> value by generating at least 16 fresh, cryptographically random bytes with sufficient entropy, associates it with the session and base64url encodes it.</t>
<t>(2) The Verifier initiates a new transaction at its Response URI.</t>
<t>(3) The Response URI will set up the transaction and respond with two fresh, cryptographically random numbers with sufficient entropy designated as <tt>transaction-id</tt> and <tt>request-id</tt>. Those values are used in the process to identify the authorization response (<tt>request-id</tt>) and to ensure only the Verifier can obtain the Authorization Response data (<tt>transaction-id</tt>).</t>
<t>(4) The Verifier then sends the Authorization Request with the <tt>request-id</tt> as <tt>state</tt> and the <tt>nonce</tt> value created in step (1) to the Wallet.</t>
<t>(5) After authenticating the End-User and getting their consent to share the request Credentials, the Wallet sends the Authorization Response with the parameters <tt>vp_token</tt>, <tt>presentation_submission</tt> (optional) and <tt>state</tt> to the <tt>response_uri</tt> of the Verifier.</t>
<t>(6) The Verifier's Response URI checks whether the <tt>state</tt> value is a valid <tt>request-id</tt>. If so, it stores the Authorization Response data linked to the respective <tt>transaction-id</tt>. It then creates a <tt>response_code</tt> as fresh, cryptographically random number with sufficient entropy that it also links with the respective Authorization Response data. It then returns the <tt>redirect_uri</tt>, which includes the <tt>response_code</tt> to the Wallet.</t>
<t>Note: If the Verifier's Response URI does not return a <tt>redirect_uri</tt>, processing at the Wallet stops at that step. The Verifier is supposed to fetch the Authorization Response without waiting for a redirect (see step 8).</t>
<t>(7) The Wallet sends the user agent to the Verifier (<tt>redirect_uri</tt>). The Verifier receives the Request and extracts the <tt>response_code</tt> parameter.</t>
<t>(8) The Verifier sends the <tt>response_code</tt> and the <tt>transaction-id</tt> from its session to the Response URI.</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>The Response URI uses the <tt>transaction-id</tt> to look the matching Authorization Response data up, which implicitly validates the <tt>transaction-id</tt> associated with the Verifier's session.</li>
<li>If an Authorization Response is found, the Response URI checks whether the <tt>response_code</tt> was associated with this Authorization Response in step (6).</li>
</ul>
<t>Note: If the Verifier's Response URI did not return a <tt>redirect_uri</tt> in step (6), the Verifier will periodically query the Response URI with the <tt>transaction-id</tt> to obtain the Authorization Response once it becomes available.</t>
<t>(9) The Response URI returns the VP Token and Presentation Submission for further processing to the Verifier.</t>
<t>(10) The Verifier checks whether the <tt>nonce</tt> received in the Credential(s) in the VP Token in step (9) corresponds to the <tt>nonce</tt> value from the session. The Verifier then consumes the VP Token and invalidates the <tt>transaction-id</tt>, <tt>request-id</tt> and <tt>nonce</tt> in the session.</t>

<section anchor="preventing-replay"><name>Preventing Replay of the VP Token</name>
<t>An attacker could try to inject a VP Token (or an individual Verifiable Presentation), that was obtained from a previous Authorization Response, into another Authorization Response thus impersonating the End-User that originally presented that VP Token or the respective Verifiable Presentation.</t>
<t>Implementers of this specification MUST implement the controls as defined in this section to detect such an attack.</t>
<t>This specification assumes that a Verifiable Credential is always presented with a cryptographic proof of possession which can be a Verifiable Presentation. This cryptographic proof of possession MUST be bound by the Wallet to the intended audience (the Client Identifier of the Verifier) and the respective transaction (identified by the <tt>nonce</tt> parameter in the Authorization Request). The Verifier MUST verify this binding.</t>
<t>The Verifier MUST create a fresh, cryptographically random number with sufficient entropy for every Authorization Request, store it with its current session, and pass it in the <tt>nonce</tt> Authorization Request Parameter to the Wallet.</t>
<t>The Wallet MUST link every Verifiable Presentation returned to the Verifier in the VP Token to the <tt>client_id</tt> and the <tt>nonce</tt> values of the respective Authentication Request.</t>
<t>The Verifier MUST validate every individual Verifiable Presentation in an Authorization Response and ensure that it is linked to the values of the <tt>client_id</tt> and the <tt>nonce</tt> parameter it had used for the respective Authorization Request. If the response contains multiple Verifiable Presentations which do not contain the same nonce value, the response is rejected.</t>
<t>The <tt>client_id</tt> is used to detect the presentation of Verifiable Credentials to a party other than the one intended. This allows Verifiers take appropriate action in that case, such as not accepting the Verifiable Presentation. The <tt>nonce</tt> value binds the Presentation to a certain authentication transaction and allows the Verifier to detect injection of a Presentation in the flow, which is especially important in the flows where the Presentation is passed through the front-channel.</t>
<t>Note: Different formats for Verifiable Presentations and signature/proof schemes use different ways to represent the intended audience and the session binding. Some use claims to directly represent those values, others include the values into the calculation of cryptographic proofs. There are also different naming conventions across the different formats. In case Presentation Exchange is used in the Authorization Request, the format of the respective presentation is determined from the format information in the presentation submission in the Authorization Response. If DCQL was used, the format was defined by the Verifier in the request.</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of the payload of a Verifiable Presentation of a format identifier <tt>jwt_vp_json</tt>:</t>

</section>

<section anchor="session_fixation"><name>Session Fixation</name>
<t>To perform a Session Fixation attack, an attacker would start the process using a Verifier executed on a device under his control, capture the Authorization Request and relay it to the device of a victim. The attacker would then periodically try to conclude the process in his Verifier, which would cause the Verifier on his device to try to fetch and verify the Authorization Response.</t>
<t>Such an attack is impossible against flows implemented with the Response Mode <tt>fragment</tt> as the Wallet will always send the VP Token to the redirect endpoint on the same device where it resides. This means an attacker could extract a valid Authorization Request from a Verifier on his device and trick a Victim into performing the same Authorization Request on her device. But there is technically no way for an attacker to get hold of the resulting VP Token.</t>
<t>However, the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> is susceptible to such an attack as the result is sent from the Wallet out-of-band to the Verifier's Response URI.</t>
<t>This kind of attack can be detected if the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> is used in conjunction with the redirect URI, which causes the Wallet to redirect the flow to the Verifier's frontend at the device where the transaction was concluded. The Verifier's Response URI MUST include a fresh secret (Response Code) into the redirect URI returned to the Wallet and the Verifier's Response URI MUST require the frontend to pass the respective Response Code when fetching the Authorization Response. That stops session fixation attacks as long as the attacker is unable to get access to the Response Code.</t>
<t>Note that this protection technique is not applicable to cross-device scenarios because the browser used by the wallet will not have the original session.
It is also not applicable in same-device scenarios if the wallet uses a browser different from the one used on the presentation request (e.g. device with multiple installed browsers), because the original session will also not be available there.</t>
<t>See <xref target="implementation_considerations_direct_post"></xref> for more implementation considerations.</t>
<t>When using the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> without the further protection provided by the redirect URI, there is no session context for the Verifier to detect session fixation attempts. It is RECOMMENDED for the Verifiers to implement mechanisms to strengthen the security of the flow. For more details on possible attacks and mitigations see <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-cross-device-security"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security_considerations_direct_post"><name>Response Mode &quot;direct_post&quot;</name>

<section anchor="validation-of-the-response-uri"><name>Validation of the Response URI</name>
<t>The Wallet MUST ensure the data in the Authorization Response cannot leak through Response URIs. When using pre-registered Response URIs, the Wallet MUST comply with best practices for redirect URI validation as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-security-topics"></xref>. The Wallet MAY also rely on a Client Identifier Scheme in conjunction with Client Authentication and integrity protection of the request to establish trust in the Response URI provided by a certain Verifier.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="protection-of-the-response-uri"><name>Protection of the Response URI</name>
<t>The Verifier SHOULD protect its Response URI from inadvertent requests by checking that the value of the received <tt>state</tt> parameter corresponds to a recent Authorization Request. It MAY also use JARM <xref target="JARM"></xref> to authenticate the originator of the request.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="protection-of-the-authorization-response-data"><name>Protection of the Authorization Response Data</name>
<t>This specification assumes that the Verifier's Response URI offers an internal interface to other components of the Verifier to obtain (and subsequently process) Authorization Response data. An attacker could try to obtain Authorization Response Data from a Verifier's Response URI by looking up this data through the internal interface. This could lead to leakage valid Verifiable Presentations containing PII.</t>
<t>Implementations of this specification MUST have security mechanisms in place to prevent inadvertent requests against this internal interface. Implementation options to fulfill this requirement include:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Authentication between the different parts within the Verifier</li>
<li>Two cryptographically random numbers.  The first being used to manage state between the Wallet and Verifier. The second being used to ensure that only a legitimate component of the Verifier can obtain the Authorization Response data.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="end-user-authentication-using-verifiable-credentials"><name>End-User Authentication using Verifiable Credentials</name>
<t>Clients intending to authenticate the End-User utilizing a claim in a Verifiable Credential MUST ensure this claim is stable for the End-User as well locally unique and never reassigned within the Credential Issuer to another End-User. Such a claim MUST also only be used in combination with the Credential Issuer identifier to ensure global uniqueness and to prevent attacks where an attacker obtains the same claim from a different Credential Issuer and tries to impersonate the legitimate End-User.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="encrypting_unsigned_response"><name>Encrypting an Unsigned Response</name>
<t>If an encrypted Authorization Response has no additional integrity protection, an attacker might be able to alter Authorization Response parameters such as <tt>presentation_submission</tt> and generate a new encrypted Authorization Response for the Verifier, as encryption is performed using the public key of the Verifier which is likely to be widely known. Note this includes injecting a new VP Token. Since the contents of the VP Token are integrity protected, tampering the VP Token is detectable by the Verifier. For details, see <xref target="preventing-replay"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="dif-presentation-exchange-2-0-0"><name>DIF Presentation Exchange 2.0.0</name>

<section anchor="fetching-presentation-definitions-by-reference"><name>Fetching Presentation Definitions by Reference</name>
<t>In many instances the referenced server will be operated by a known federation or other trusted operator, and the URL's domain name will already be widely known. Wallets using this URI can mitigate request forgeries by having a pre-configured set of trusted domain names and only fetching Presentation Definition from these sources. In addition, the Presentation Definitions could be signed by a trusted authority, such as the federation operator.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="jsonpath-and-arbitrary-scripting"><name>JSONPath and Arbitrary Scripting</name>
<t>Implementers MUST make sure that JSONPath used as part of <tt>presentation_definition</tt> and <tt>presentation_submission</tt> parameters cannot be used to execute arbitrary scripts on a server. This can be achieved, for example, by implementing the entire syntax of the query without relying on the parsers of programming language engine. For details, see Section 4 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-jsonpath-base"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="filters-property"><name>Filters Property</name>
<t>Implementers should be careful with what is used as a filter property in <xref target="DIF.PresentationExchange"></xref>. For example, when using regular expressions or JSON Schemas as filters, implementers should ensure that computations and resource access are bounded with the security in mind to prevent attacks such as denial of service or unauthorized access.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="tls-requirements"><name>TLS Requirements</name>
<t>Implementations MUST follow <xref target="BCP195"></xref>.</t>
<t>Whenever TLS is used, a TLS server certificate check MUST be performed, per <xref target="RFC6125"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="privacy-considerations"><name>Privacy Considerations</name>

<section anchor="authorization-requests-with-request-uri"><name>Authorization Requests with Request URI</name>
<t>If the Wallet is acting within a trust framework that allows the Wallet to determine whether a 'request_uri' belongs to a certain 'client_id', the Wallet is RECOMMENDED to validate the Verifier's authenticity and authorization given by 'client_id' and that the 'request_uri' corresponds to this Verifier. If the link cannot be established in those cases, the Wallet SHOULD refuse the request or ask the End-User for advise.</t>
<t>If no End-User interaction is required before sending the request, it is easy to request on a large scale and in an automated fashion the wallet capabilities from all visitors of a website. Even without personally identifiable information (PII) this can reveal some information about End-Users, like their nationality (e.g., a Wallet with special capabilities only used in one EU member state).</t>
<t>Mandatory End-User interaction before sending the request, like clicking a button, unlocking the wallet or even just showing a screen of the app, can make this less attractive/likely to being exploited.</t>
<t>Requests from the Wallet to the Verifier SHOULD be sent with the minimal amount of information possible, and in particular, without any HTTP headers identifying the software used for the request (e.g., HTTP libraries or their versions). The Wallet MUST NOT send PII or any other data that could be used for fingerprinting to the Request URI in order to prevent End-User tracking.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="authorization-error-response-with-the-wallet-unavailable-error-code"><name>Authorization Error Response with the <tt>wallet_unavailable</tt> error code</name>
<t>In the event that another component is invoked instead of the Wallet, the End-User MUST be informed and give consent before the invoked component returns the <tt>wallet_unavailable</tt> Authorization Error Response to the Verifier.</t>

<section anchor="openid4vp-over-the-digital-credentials-api"><name>OpenID4VP over the Digital Credentials API</name>
<t>This section defines how to use OpenID4VP with the Digital Credentials API.</t>
<t>The name &quot;Digital Credentials API&quot; (DC API) encomposes the W3C Digital Credentials API <xref target="W3C.Digital_Credentials_API"></xref>
as well as its native App Platform equivalents in operating systems (such as <eref target="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/credentials">Credential Manager on Android</eref>).
The DC API allows web sites and native apps acting as Verifiers to request the presentation of verifiable credentials.
The API itself is agnostic to the Credential exchange protocol and can be used with different protocols.
The Web Platform, working in conjunction with other layers, such as the app platform/operating system, and based on the permission of the End-User, will send the request data along with the web or app origin of the Verifier to the End-User's chosen Wallet.</t>
<t>OpenID4VP over the DC API utilizes the mechanisms of the DC API while also allowing to leverage advanced security features of OpenID4VP, if needed.
It also defines the OpenID4VP request parameters that MAY be used with the DC API.</t>
<t>The DC API offers several advantages for implementers of both Verifiers and Wallets.</t>
<t>Firstly, the API serves as a privacy-preserving alternative to invoking Wallets via URLs, particularly custom URL schemes. The underlying app platform will only invoke a Wallet if the End-User confirms the request based on contextual information about the Credential Request and the requestor (Verifier).</t>
<t>Secondly, the session with the End-User will always continue in the initial context, typically a web browser tab, when the request has been fulfilled (or aborted), which results in an improved user experience.</t>
<t>Thirdly, cross-device requests benefit from the use of secure transports with proximity checks, which are handled by the OS platform, e.g., using FIDO CTAP 2.2 with hybrid transports.</t>
<t>And lastly, as part of the request, the Wallet is provided with information about the Verifier's origin as authenticated by the user agent, which is important for phishing resistance.</t>

<section anchor="protocol"><name>Protocol</name>
<t>To use OpenID4VP over the DC API, the value of the exchange protocol used with the Digital Credentials API (DC API), is <tt>openid4vp</tt>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="dc_api_request"><name>Request</name>
<t>The Verifier MAY send all the OpenID4VP request parameters to the Digital Credentials API (DC API).</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of an unsigned OpenID4VP request (when advanced security features of OpenID4VP are not used) that can be sent over the DC API :</t>

<sourcecode type="js">{
  response_type: &quot;vp_token&quot;,
  response_mode: &quot;dc_api&quot;,
  nonce: &quot;n-0S6_WzA2Mj&quot;,
  client_metadata: {...},
  dcql_query: {...}
}
</sourcecode>
<t>Out of the Authorization Request parameters defined in <xref target="RFC6749"></xref> and <xref target="vp_token_request"></xref>, the following are supported with OpenID4VP over the W3C Digital Credentials API:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>client_id</tt></li>
<li><tt>response_type</tt></li>
<li><tt>response_mode</tt></li>
<li><tt>nonce</tt></li>
<li><tt>presentation_definition</tt></li>
<li><tt>client_metadata</tt></li>
<li><tt>request</tt></li>
<li><tt>transaction_data</tt></li>
<li><tt>dcql_query</tt></li>
</ul>
<t>The <tt>client_id</tt> parameter MUST be omitted in unsigned requests defined in <xref target="unsigned_request"></xref>. The Wallet determines the effective Client Identifier from the origin as asserted by the Web Platform and/or app platform. The effective Client Identifier is composed of a synthetic Client Identifier Scheme of <tt>web-origin</tt> and the origin itself. For example, an origin of <tt>https://verifier.example.com</tt> would result in an effective Client Identifier of <tt>web-origin:https://verifier.example.com</tt>. The transport of the request and origin from the Web Platform and/or app platform to the Wallet is platform-specific and is out of scope of OpenID4VP over the W3C Digital Credentials API.</t>
<t>The value of the <tt>response_mode</tt> parameter MUST be <tt>dc_api</tt> when the response is neither signed nor encrypted and <tt>dc_api.jwt</tt> when the response is signed and/or encrypted as defined in <xref target="jarm"></xref>.</t>
<t>In addition to the above-mentioned parameters, a new parameter is introduced for OpenID4VP over the W3C Digital Credentials API:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>expected_origins</tt>: REQUIRED when signed requests defined in <xref target="signed_request"></xref> are used with the Digital Credentials API (DC API). An array of strings, each string representing an origin of the Verifier that is making the request. The Wallet can detect replay of the request from a malicious Verifier by comparing values in this parameter to the origin asserted by the Web Platform.</li>
</ul>
<t>Additional request parameters MAY be defined and used with OpenID4VP over the DC API.</t>
<t>The Wallet MUST ignore any unrecognized parameters.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="signed-and-unsigned-requests"><name>Signed and Unsigned Requests</name>
<t>Any OpenID4VP request compliant to this section of this specification can be used with the Digital Credentials API (DC API). Depending on the mechanism used to identify and authenticate the Verifier, the request can be signed or unsigned. This section defines signed and unsigned OpenID4VP requests for use with the DC API.</t>

<section anchor="unsigned_request"><name>Unsigned Request</name>
<t>The Verifier MAY send all the OpenID4VP request parameters as members in the request member passed to the API. In this case, the Wallet will use the Verifier's origin as asserted by the user agent to determine the Verifier's effective Client Identifier.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="signed_request"><name>Signed Request</name>
<t>The Verifier MAY send a signed request, for example, when identification and authentication of the Verifier is required.</t>
<t>The signed Request Object MAY contain all the parameters listed in <xref target="dc_api_request"></xref>, except <tt>request</tt>.</t>
<t>Below is a non-normative example of such a request sent over the Digital Credentials API (DC API):</t>

<sourcecode type="js">{ request: &quot;eyJhbGciOiJF...&quot; }
</sourcecode>
<t>This is an example of the payload of a signed OpenID4VP request used with the DC API:</t>

<sourcecode type="json">{
  &quot;client_id&quot;: &quot;https://client.example.org&quot;,
  &quot;expected_origins&quot;: [
    &quot;https://origin1.example.com&quot;,
    &quot;https://origin2.example.com&quot;
  ],
  &quot;response_type&quot;: &quot;vp_token&quot;,
  &quot;response_mode&quot;: &quot;dc_api.jwt&quot;,
  &quot;nonce&quot;: &quot;n-0S6_WzA2Mj&quot;,
  &quot;client_metadata&quot;: {
    &quot;vp_formats&quot;: {
      &quot;dc+sd-jwt&quot;: {
        &quot;sd-jwt_alg_values&quot;: [ &quot;PS256&quot; ],
        &quot;kb-jwt_alg_values&quot;: [ &quot;PS256&quot; ]
      }
    },
    &quot;jwks&quot;: {
      &quot;keys&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;kty&quot;: &quot;EC&quot;,
          &quot;crv&quot;: &quot;P-256&quot;,
          &quot;x&quot;: &quot;MKBCTNIcKUSDii11ySs3526iDZ8AiTo7Tu6KPAqv7D4&quot;,
          &quot;y&quot;: &quot;4Etl6SRW2YiLUrN5vfvVHuhp7x8PxltmWWlbbM4IFyM&quot;,
          &quot;use&quot;: &quot;enc&quot;,
          &quot;kid&quot;: &quot;1&quot;
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  &quot;presentation_definition&quot;: {...}
}
</sourcecode>
<t>The signed request allows the Wallet to authenticate the Verifier using a trust framework other than the Web PKI utilized by the browser. An example of such a trust framework is the Verifier (RP) management infrastructure set up in the context of the eIDAS regulation in the European Union, in which case, the Wallet can no longer rely only on the web origin of the Verifier. This web origin MAY still be used to further strengthen the security of the flow. The external trust framework could, for example, map the Client Identifier to registered web origins.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="response-1"><name>Response</name>
<t>Every OpenID4VP Authorization Request results in a response being provided through the Digital Credentials API (DC API). The response is an instance of the <tt>DigitalCredential</tt> interface, as defined in <xref target="W3C.Digital_Credentials_API"></xref>, and the OpenID4VP Authorization Response parameters as defined for the Response Type are represented as an object within the <tt>data</tt> attribute.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="format_specific_parameters"><name>Credential Format Specific Parameters</name>
<t>OpenID for Verifiable Presentations is Credential Format agnostic, i.e., it is designed to allow applications to request and receive Verifiable Presentations and Verifiable Credentials in any Credential Format. This section defines a set of Credential Format specific parameters for some of the known Credential Formats. For the Credential Formats that are not mentioned in this specification, other specifications or deployments can define their own set of Credential Format specific parameters.</t>

<section anchor="w3c-verifiable-credentials"><name>W3C Verifiable Credentials</name>
<t>W3C Verifiable Credentials may use an additional parameter for the <tt>descriptor_map</tt> with the <tt>presentation_submission</tt>: The <tt>path_nested</tt> object inside an Input Descriptor Mapping Object is used to describe how to find a returned Credential within a Verifiable Presentation, and contains a <tt>format</tt> parameter with the Credential format identifier as a value and a <tt>path</tt> parameter with a relative path to the Verifiable Credential. Non-normative examples can be found further in this section.</t>

<section anchor="jwt_vc"><name>VC signed as a JWT, not using JSON-LD</name>
<t>This section illustrates presentation of a Credential conformant to <xref target="VC_DATA"></xref> that is signed using JWS, and does not use JSON-LD.</t>
<t>The Credential format identifiers are <tt>jwt_vc_json</tt> for a W3C Verifiable Credential and <tt>jwt_vp_json</tt> for W3C Verifiable Presentation.</t>
<t>Cipher suites should use algorithm names defined in <eref target="https://www.iana.org/assignments/jose/jose.xhtml#web-signature-encryption-algorithms">IANA JOSE Algorithms Registry</eref>.</t>

<section anchor="example-credential"><name>Example Credential</name>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of the payload of a JWT-based W3C Verifiable Credential that will be used throughout this section:</t>

<t>This example is identical to the previous one with the following exceptions: It sets the element <tt>limit_disclosure</tt> of the constraint to <tt>require</tt> and adds two more constraints for the individual claims <tt>given_name</tt> and <tt>family_name</tt>.

<t>Setting <tt>limit_disclosure</tt> property defined in <xref target="DIF.PresentationExchange"></xref> to <tt>required</tt> enables selective release by instructing the Wallet to submit only the disclosures for the matching claims specified in the fields array. The unsecured payload of an IETF SD-JWT VC is used to perform the matching.</t>

<t>The <tt>transaction_data_hashes</tt> response parameter defined in <xref target="transaction_data"></xref> MUST be included in the Key Binding JWT as a top level claim. This means that transaction data mechanism cannot be used with SD-JWT VCs without cryptographic key binding and, therefore, do not use KB JWT.</t>

<t>The differences to the example requests in the previous sections are:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>response_type</tt> is set to <tt>vp_token id_token</tt>. This means the Wallet returns the <tt>presentation_submission</tt> and <tt>vp_token</tt> parameters in the same response as the <tt>id_token</tt> parameter as described in <xref target="response"></xref>.</li>
<li>The request includes the <tt>scope</tt> parameter with value <tt>openid</tt> making this an OpenID Connect request. Additionally, the request also contains the parameter <tt>id_token_type</tt> with value <tt>subject_signed</tt> requesting a Self-Issuer ID Token, i.e., the request is a SIOP request.</li>
</ul>
