1.  Introduction

   This specification defines an extension to OpenID Connect [OpenID] to
   address the use case of strong identity verification of a natural
   person in accordance with certain laws.  Examples include Anti Money




Lodderstedt & Fett      Expires October 24, 2019                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft     openid-connect-4-identity-assurance        April 2019


   Laundering Laws, Telecommunication Acts, Anti Terror Laws, and
   regulations on trust services, such as eIDAS [eIDAS].

   In such use cases, the Relying Parties (RPs) need to know the
   assurance level of the user claims attested by the OpenID Connect
   Providers (OPs) along with evidences related to the identity
   verification process (identity assurance).

   Identity assurance signficantly differs from authentication
   assurance, which requires a different, currently unsupported,
   representation in the OpenID Connect protocol.

   The assurance level for authentication is a property of a certain
   OpenID Connect transaction, determined by the authentication means
   employed and the underlying user account management processes.  The
   "acr" claim as defined in Section 2 of the OpenID Connect
   specification [OpenID] is sufficient to convey this information.

   The identity assurance for user claims, i.e. the binding of a certain
   claim value to the person controlling the respective user account,
   typically varies among the different user claims.  For example, the
   assurance an OP typically will be able to attest for an e-mail
   address will be "self-asserted", "verified by opt-in", or "verified
   by the respective e-mail provider via an attribute exchange
   protocol".  The family name of a user, in contrast, might have been
   verified in accordance with the respective Anti Money Laundering Law
   by showing an ID Card to a trained employee of the OP operator.

   Identity assurance therefore requires a way to convey assurance data
   along with and coupled to the respective user claims.  This
   specification proposes a suitable representation and mechanisms the
   RP will utilize to request verified person data and accompanying
   identity assurance data.

1.1.  Terminology

   This section defines some terms relevant to the topic covered in this
   documents, heavily inspired by NIST SP 800-63A [NIST-SP-800-63a].

   o  Identity Proofing - process in which a user provides evidence to
      an OP reliably identifying themselves, thereby allowing the OP to
      assert that identification at a useful identity assurance level.

   o  Identify Verification - process conducted by the OP to verify the
      user's identity

   o  Identity Assurance - process in which the OP attests identity data
      of a certain user with a certain assurance towards a RP, typically



Lodderstedt & Fett      Expires October 24, 2019                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     openid-connect-4-identity-assurance        April 2019


      expressed by way of an assurance level.  Depending on legal
      requirements, the OP may also be required to provide evidences of
      the identity proofing process to the RP.

2.  Scope and Requirements

   The extension specified in this document shall

   o  allow an OpenID Connect RP to request identity data and to express
      requirements regarding this data and the evidences and processes
      employed,

   o  allow an OP to attest identity data obtained and maintained in
      accordance with a certain law, and

   o  allow the RP to map the data obtained from the OP to other laws,
      e.g. it shall be possible to use identity data maintained in
      accordance with the Anti Money Laundering Law to fulfill
      requirements defined by eIDAS.

   The scope of the extension is to define mechanisms to assert verified
   person data.

   It SHALL be possible to use existing OpenID Connect claims and other
   extensions defined beside this extension within the same OpenID
   Connect transaction and especially to render the same ID token or
   other representations utilized to convey user claims.  For example,
   OpenID Connect already defines additional claims to inform the RP of
   the verification status of the "phone_number" and "email" claims.

   If necessary, this extension will introduce new user claims to cover
   user attributes not currently covered by OpenID Connect, one example
   is the "place_of_birth".

   The extension MUST allow the OP to attest verified and unverified
   claims in the same response.

   The representation defined in this specification is intended to be
   used to provide RPs with verified person data via any appropriate
   channel.  In the context of OpenID Connnect, verified person data can
   be attested in ID Tokens or as part of the User Info response.  It is
   also possible to utilize the format described here in OAuth Token
   Introspection responses (see [RFC7662] and
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-jwt-introspection-response]) to provide resource
   servers with verified person data.

   This extension defines a way to assert verified claims only.  There
   is no need to cover self-asserted claims, or better put claims



Lodderstedt & Fett      Expires October 24, 2019                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     openid-connect-4-identity-assurance        April 2019


   without further information about the assurance, since they are
   already covered by OpenID Connect Core [OpenID].

   Even for asserting verified claims, this extension shall attempt to
   utilize existing OpenID Connect claims if possible and reasonable.
   It MUST, however, ensure developers cannot interpret non-verified
   claims as verified claims.

   The representation defined in this extension SHALL allow RPs to
   obtain assertions about verified claims from different OPs using
   different trust frameworks.

   This extension SHALL be usable by OPs operating under a regulation,
   such as eIDAS, as well as other OPs.  The former, called "notified
   eID system" in eIDAS, can attest identity data without the need to
   provide further evidences since they are operating under a well-
   defined regulation with clearly defined liability.  For example in
   case of eIDAS, the respective member state takes the liability for
   the identities asserted by its notified eID system.  The latter do
   not operate under such well-defined conditions, which typically
   requires the RP to obtain more data about the identity verification
   process and assess its applicability in its own legal context.

   From a technical perspective, this means this specification needs to
   support cases, where basically verified person data are provided
   along with the information about the regulatory framework (trust
   framework) the OP complies with and the respective level of
   assurance, whereas there shall also be support to externalize
   information about the identity verification process with the OP to
   the RP.

   Note: data transfer between OP and RP requires a legal basis that
   MUST be established upfront or in the course of the OpenID process.

3.  Claims

3.1.  User Claims

   In order to fulfill the requirements of some jurisdictions on
   identity assurance, this specification defines the following claims
   for conveying user data (in addition to the claims defined in the
   OpenID Connect specification [OpenID]:

   o  "place_of_birth": a structured claim representing the end-user's
      place of birth.  It consists of the following fields:

      *  "country": ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2, e.g.  DE, or ISO 3166-3




Lodderstedt & Fett      Expires October 24, 2019                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     openid-connect-4-identity-assurance        April 2019


      *  "locality": city or other locality

   o  "nationality": represents the user's nationality in format ISO
      3166-1 Alpha-2, e.g.  DE

   o  "birth_name": family name someone has when he or she is born, or
      at least from the time he or she is a child.  This term can be
      used by a man or a woman who changes a name later in life for any
      reason.

   o  "salutation": end-user's salutation, e.g.  "Mr."

   o  "title": end-user's title, e.g.  "Dr."

3.2.  transaction_id

   Strong identity verification typically requires the participants to
   keep an audit trail of the whole process.

   This specification supports building an audit trail across the
   boundaries between OP and RP by introducing the claim
   "transaction_id".

   The "transaction_id" claim is a string value which

   o  MUST be unique within the context of the respective OP,

   o  MUST uniquely identify a certain transaction at the OP, and

   o  MUST allow an RP to obtain further transaction details if needed.

   The OP MUST maintain a corresponding audit trail for any transaction
   which leads to the attestation of verified person data.  Those
   details consist of

   o  the transaction id,

   o  the authentication methods employed, and

   o  the transaction type (e.g. scope values).

   The OP MUST store the transaction data as long as it is required to
   store transaction data for auditing purposes by respective
   regulations.

   The RP requests this claim like any other claim via the claims
   parameter or as part of a default claim set identified by a scope
   value.

4.  Verified Data Representation

   This extension to OpenID Connect wants to ensure that RPs cannot
   mixup verified and unverified claims and incidentally process
   unverified claims as verified claims.

   The representation proposed therefore provides the RP with the
   verified claims within a structured claim "verified_person_data".
   This structured claim is composed of the verification evidences
   related to a certain verification process and the corresponding user
   claims which were verified in this process.

   The "verified_person_data" claim consists of the following sub-
   elements:

   o  "verification": This element contains all data about the
      verification process.

   o  "claims": This element is the container for the verified user
      claims.

4.1.  verification Element

   This element contains the information about the process conducted to
   verify a person's identity and bind the respective person data to a
   user account.

   The "verification" element consists of the following elements:

   "trust_framework": REQUIRED.  URI determing the trust framework
   governing the identity verification process and the identity
   assurance level of the OP.

   An example value is "https://openid.net/trust_frameworks/eidas/
   loa_high" [1], which denotes a notified eID system under eIDAS
   providing identity assurance at level of assurance "High".

   Standardized values are defined in Trust Frameworks [2].

   The "trust_framework" value determines what further data is provided
   to the RP in the "verification" element.  A notified eID system under
   eIDAS, for example, would not need to provide any further data
   whereas an OP not governed by eIDAS would need to provide
   verification evidences in order to allow the RP to fulfill its legal
   obligations.  An example of the latter is an OP acting under the
   German Anti-Money laundering law
   ("https://openid.net/trust_frameworks/de/aml" [3]).

   "date": CONDITIONALLY REQUIRED.  Time stamp in ISO 8601:2004 YYYY-MM-
   DD format representing the date when identity verification took
   place.

   "id": CONDITIONALLY REQUIRED.  Unique reference to the identity
   verification process as performed by the OP.  Used for backtracing in
   case of disputes or audits.  Note: In contrast to this field, the
   claim "transaction_id" refers to the transaction leading the OP to
   attest the user's verified identity data towards a RP.

   "method": CONDITIONALLY REQUIRED.  Method utilized for identity
   verification - Depending on the value of "method", there will be
   different additional sub-elements with the name of the method in the
   verification element - possible values are

   o  "identity_document": verification of a physical document

   o  "eID": verification using an electronic ID Card

4.1.1.  Method-specific elements

   The following elements are contained in an "identity_document" sub-
   element.

   "country": String denoting the country where the document was issued,
   format: ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2, e.g.  "DE".

   "type": REQUIRED.  String denoting the type of the id document,
   standardized values are defined in Identity Documents [4].

   The OP MAY use other than the predefined values in which case the RPs
   will either be unable to process the assertion, just store this value
   for audit purposes, or apply bespoken business logic to it.

   "issuer": REQUIRED.  String representing the issuer of the identity
   document

   "number": REQUIRED.  String representing the number of the identity
   document

   "date_of_issuance": CONDITIONALLY REQUIRED.  The date the document
   was issued as ISO 8601:2004 YYYY-MM-DD format, if this attribute
   exists for the particular type of document.

   "date_of_expiry": CONDITIONALLY REQUIRED.  The date the document will
   expire as ISO 8601:2004 YYYY-MM-DD format, if this attribute exists
   for the particular type of document.

Internet-Draft     openid-connect-4-identity-assurance        April 2019


   "method": The method used to verify the document, predefined values
   are given in Verification Methods [5]

   "organization": CONDITIONALLY REQUIRED.  String denoting the
   organization which performed the verification on behalf of the OP.
   Can be omitted if this is the OP itself.

   "agent": OPTIONAL.  Agent (person) who conducted the verification.
   The agent may be identified by Name or an identifier which can be
   resolved into the agent's name during an audit.

   The following elements are contained in an "eID" sub-element:

   "country": REQUIRED.  Country where the eID was issued: ISO 3166-1
   Alpha-2, e.g.  DE

   "type": String denoting the type of eID, standardized values are
   defined in Identity Documents [6].

   "identifier": REQUIRED. person identifier obtained by the OP from the
   eID system

4.2.  claims Element

   The "claims" element contains the user claims which were verified by
   the process and according to the policies determined by the
   corresponding "verification" element.

   The "claims" element MAY contain one or more of the following user
   claims as defined in Section 5.1 of the OpenID Connect specification
   [OpenID]

   o  "name"

   o  "given_name"

   o  "middle_name"

   o  "family_name"

   o  "birthdate"

   o  "address"

   or of the following claims as defined in Section User Claims [7]:

   o  "place_of_birth"

Internet-Draft     openid-connect-4-identity-assurance        April 2019


   o  "nationality"

   o  "birth_name"

   The "claims" element MAY also contain other claims given the value of
   the respective claim was verified in the verification process
   represented by the sibling "verification" element.

5.  Requesting Verified Person Data

5.1.  Requesting User Claims

   Verified person data can be requested on the level of individual user
   claims by utilzing the "claims" parameter as defined in Section 5.5.
   of the OpenID Connect specification [OpenID].

   Bassically, the claim "verified_person_data" is added to the section
   "userinfo" or "id_token" of the "claims" parameter.

   Since "verified_person_data" contains the effective user claims in a
   nested "claims" element, the syntax is extended to include
   expressions on nested elements as follows.  The
   "verified_person_data" element includes a "claims" element, which in
   turn includes the desired user claims as keys with a "null" value.
   An example is shown in the following:

   {
      "userinfo":{
         "verified_person_data":{
            "claims":{
               "given_name":null,
               "family_name":null,
               "birthdate":null,
            }
         }
      }
   }

   Use of the "claims" parameter allows the RP to exactly select the
   user claims needed for its use case.  This extension therefore allows
   RPs to fulfill the requirement for data minimization.

   RPs MAY indicate that a certain claim is essential to the sucessful
   completion of the user journey by utilizing the "essential" field as
   defined in Section 5.5.1. of the OpenID Connect specification
   [OpenID].  The following example designates both given as well as
   family name as being essential.

Internet-Draft     openid-connect-4-identity-assurance        April 2019


   {
      "userinfo":{
         "verified_person_data":{
            "claims":{
               "given_name":{"essential": true},
               "family_name":{"essential": true},
               "birthdate":null,
            }
         }
      }
   }

   Note: A "claims" sub-element with value "null" is interpreted as a
   request for all possible claims.  An example is shown in the
   following:

   {
      "userinfo":{
         "verified_person_data":{
            "claims":null
         }
      }
   }

   Note: The "claims" sub-element can be omitted, which is equivalent to
   a claims element whose value is "null".

   Note: If the "claims" sub-element is empty or contains a claim other
   than the claims listed in the Section claims [8], the OP will abort
   the transaction with an "invalid_request" error.

5.2.  Defining constraints on requested data

   The RP MAY express requirements regarding the elements in the
   verification sub-element.

   This, again, requires an extension to the syntax as defined in
   Section 5.5. of the OpenID Connect Core specification [OpenID] due to
   the nested nature of the "verified_person_data" claim.

   Section 5.5.1 of the OpenID Connect Core specification [OpenID]
   defines a query syntax that allows for the member value of the claim
   being requested to be a JSON object with additional information/
   constraints on the claim.  For doing so it defines three members
   ("essential", "value" and "values") with special query meanings and
   allows for other special members to be defined (while stating that
   any members that are not understood must be ignored).

   This specification re-uses this mechanics and introduces a new such
   member "max_age" (see below).

   To start with, the RP may limit the possible values of the elements
   "trust_framework", "identity_document", and "identity_document/
   method" by utilizing the "value" or "values" fields.

   The following example shows that the RP wants to obtain an
   attestation based on AML and limited to users who were identified in
   a bank branch using government issued id documents.

{

   The RP may also express a requirement regarding the age of the
   verification data, i.e., the time elapsed since the verification
   process asserted in the "verification" element has taken place.

   This specification therefore defines a new member "max_age".

   "max_age": OPTIONAL.  Only applicable to claims that contain dates or
   timestamps.  Defines the maximum time (in seconds) to be allowed to
   elapse since the value of the date/timestamp up to the point in time
   of the request.  The IDP should make the calculation of elapsed time
   starting from the last valid second of the date value.  The following
   is an example of a request for claims where the verification process
   of the data is not allowed to be older than 63113852 seconds.

   The following is an example:

   {
      "userinfo":{
         "verified_person_data":{
            "verification":{
               "date":{
                  "max_age":"63113852"
               }
            },
            "claims":null
         }
      }
   }

   The OP SHOULD try to fulfill this requirement.  If the verification
   data of the user is older than the requested "max_age", the OP MAY
   attempt to refresh the user's verification by sending her through a
   online identity verification process, e.g. by utilizing an electronic
   ID card or a video identification approach.

   If the OP is unable to fulfill the requirement (even in case it is
   marked as being "essential"), it will provide the RP with the data
   available and the RP may decide how to use the data.  The OP MUST NOT
   return an error in case it cannot return all claims requested as
   essential claims.

6.  Examples

   The following sections show examples of "verified_person_data"
   objects.

   The first section illustrate the contents of this object in case of a
   notified eID system.

   The second and third section show JSON snippets of the identity
   assurance by an unregulated OP, providing the RP with verification
   evidences for different verification methods along with the actual
   user claims.

   Subsequent sections contain examples of different channels and
   combinations of verified and non-verified user claims.

7.  OP Metadata

   The OP advertises its capabilities with respect to verified person
   data in its openid-configuration (see [OpenID-Discovery]) using the
   following new elements:

   "trust_frameworks_supported" This is a JSON array containing all
   supported trust frameworks and assurance levels.

   "verified_person_data_supported" This JSON array contains all claims
   supported within "verified_person_data".

   "verification_methods_supported" This element is a JSON array
   containing at the top level the verification methods as defined in
   Section verification [9]. "eID" is a simple JSON string whereas
   "identity_document" is contained in a JSON object and is itself an
   array containing all identity document proofing methods employed by
   the respective OP.

   This is an example openid-configuration snippet:
