Abstract

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   protocol.  It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
   based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
   well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
   interoperable and RESTful manner.

   This specification only defines the endpoints and the associated
   message formats.  The actual use MUST be based on one of the
   companion protocol bindings specifications such as OpenID Connect
   Standard.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are
   to be taken literally.  When using these values in protocol messages,
   the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Refresh Token",
   "Authorization Code", "Authorization Grant", "Authorization Server",
   "Authorization Endpoint", "Client", "Client Identifier", "Client
   Secret", "Protected Resource", "Resource Owner", "Resource Server",
   and "Token Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2.0], and the terms
   "Claim Names" and "Claim Values" defined by JSON Web Token (JWT)
   [JWT].  This specification also defines the following terms:

   Authentication  An act of verifying End-User's possession of
      previously provisioned credentials.

   Authentication Context  Information that the Relying Party may
      require before it makes an entitlements decision with respect to
      an authentication response.  Such context may include, but is not
      limited to, the actual authentication method used or level of
      assurance such as ITU-T X.1254 | ISO/IEC 29115 [ISO29115] entity
      authentication assurance level.

   Authentication Context Class Reference  Identifier that identifies
      the Authentication Context.

   Claim  A piece of information about an Entity that a Claims Provider
      asserts about that Entity.

   Claims Provider  A Server that can return Claims about an Entity.

   End-User  A human Resource Owner.

   Entity  Something that has a separate and distinct existence and that
      can be identified in context.  An End-User is one example of an
      Entity.

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


   Personally Identifiable Information (PII)  Any information that (a)
      can be used to identify the natural person to whom such
      information relates, or (b) is or might be directly or indirectly
      linked to a natural person to whom such information relates.

   Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID)  An identifier that
      identifies the Entity to a Relying Party.  An Entity's PPID at one
      Relying Party cannot be correlated with the Entity's PPID at
      another Relying Party.

   ID Token  A token that contains Claims about the authentication
      event.

   Issuer  An Entity that issues a set of Claims.

   Issuer Identifier  A verifiable identifier for an Issuer.  An Issuer
      Identifier is an HTTPS URL that only contains scheme, host, and
      OPTIONALLY, port number components.  (No path component may be
      present.)

   Message  A request or a response between an OpenID Relying Party and
      an OpenID Provider.

   OpenID Provider (OP)  A service capable of providing Claims to a
      Relying Party.

   OP Endpoints  Authorization Endpoint, Token Endpoint, and UserInfo
      Endpoint.

   OpenID Request Object  A JSON object that holds the OpenID request
      parameters.

   Relying Party (RP)  An application requiring Claims from an OpenID
      Provider.

   Check ID Endpoint  A resource that, when presented with an ID Token
      by the Client, returns Claims about the user session represented
      by that ID Token.

   UserInfo Endpoint  A Protected Resource that, when presented with an
      Access Token by the Client, returns Claims about the End-User
      represented by that Access Token.

1.3.  Overview

   The OpenID Connect protocol, in abstract, follows the following
   steps.

   1.  The Client sends a request to the Authorization Server's End-User
       Authorization Endpoint.

   2.  The Authorization Server authenticates the End-User and obtains
       appropriate authorization.

   3.  The Authorization Server responds with an Access Token, an Id
       Token, and a few other variables.

   4.  Optionally, the Client sends a request with the ID Token to the
       Authorization Server's Check ID Endpoint (Section 2.3).

   5.  Optionally, the Check ID Endpoint responds with authentication
       information pertaining to the supplied ID Token.

   6.  The Client sends a request with the Access Token to the UserInfo
       Endpoint (Section 2.4).

   7.  UserInfo Endpoint returns the additional End-User information
       supported by the Resource Server.

   This specification only defines the abstract message flow and message
   formats.  The actual use MUST be based on one of the companion
   protocol bindings specifications such as OpenID Connect Basic Client
   [OpenID.Basic] or OpenID Connect Standard [OpenID.Standard].

2.  Messages

   In OpenID Connect protocols, in abstract, the process proceeds by the
   Client interacting with endpoints.  There are a number of endpoints
   involved.

   1.  Authorization Endpoint: The Client sends a request to the
       Authorization Server at the Authorization Endpoint.  The
       Authorization Server then authenticates the End-User to find out
       if he is eligible to make the authorization.  Then, upon the
       authorization action of the End-User, the Authorization Server
       returns an Authorization Response that includes Authorization
       Code, "code".  For some Clients, Implicit Grant may be used to
       obtain "access_token" without using "code".  In this case,
       "response_type" MUST include "token".

   2.  Token Endpoint: The Client sends the Access Token Request to the
       Token Endpoint to obtain an Access Token Response which includes
       an "access_token".

   3.  UserInfo Endpoint: The "access_token" MAY be sent to the UserInfo
       Endpoint to obtain Claims about the End-User.

   4.  Check ID Endpoint: An ID Token MAY be sent to the Check ID
       Endpoint to obtain information about the authentication event.

2.1.  Authorization Endpoint

   The Client sends an Authorization Request to the Authorization
   Endpoint to obtain either an Authorization Response or an ID Token
   (Section 2.1.1) or both depending on "response_type" and "scope".

2.1.1.  ID Token

   The ID Token is a token that contains Claims about the authentication
   event.  The Token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) [JWT].

   The ID Token is used to manage the authentication event and user
   identifier and is scoped to a particular Client via the "aud"
   (audience) and "nonce" Claims.  It is used as an Access Token for the
   Check ID Endpoint, or consumed directly by the Client.

   The ID Token MUST minimally attest to the following Claims:

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


   iss  REQUIRED.  The Issuer Identifier for the Issuer of the response.

   user_id  REQUIRED.  A locally unique and never reassigned identifier
      within the Issuer for the End-User, which is intended to be
      consumed by the Client. e.g. "24400320" or
      "AItOawmwtWwcT0k51BayewNvutrJUqsvl6qs7A4".  It MUST NOT exceed 255
      ASCII characters in length.

   aud  REQUIRED.  This member identifies the audience that this ID
      Token is intended for.  It MUST be the OAuth 2.0 "client_id" of
      the Client.

   exp  REQUIRED.  Type Integer.  Identifies the expiration time on or
      after which the ID Token MUST NOT be accepted for processing.  The
      processing of this parameter requires that the current date/time
      MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the value.
      Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no more
      than a few minutes, to account for clock skew.  The value is
      number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until
      the desired date/time.  See RFC 3339 [RFC3339] for details
      regarding date/times in general and UTC in particular.

   acr  OPTIONAL.  (Authentication Context Class Reference): Specifies
      an Authentication Context Class Reference of the ID Token.  The
      values "1", "2", "3", and "4" map to the ITU-T X.1254 | ISO/IEC
      29115 [ISO29115] entity authentication assurance level of the
      authentication performed.  The value "0" indicates the End User
      authentication did not meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 29115
      level 1.  Authentication using a long-lived browser cookie, for
      instance, is one example where the use of "level 0" is
      appropriate.  Authentications with level 0 should never be used to
      authorize access to any resource of any monetary value.  (This
      corresponds to the OpenID 2.0 PAPE "nist_auth_level" 0.)  An
      absolute URI or a registered short name [LoA.Registry] MAY be used
      as an "acr" value.

   nonce  REQUIRED.  Clients MUST verify that the "nonce" value is equal
      to the value of the "nonce" parameter in the Authorization
      Request.

   auth_time  OPTIONAL.  If the id_token (Section 2.1.2.1.2) member of
      the OpenID Request Object (Section 2.1.2.1) contains the Claim
      request "auth_time", then this Claim is REQUIRED.  The Claim Value
      is the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC
      until the date/time that the End-User authentication occurred.
      (The "auth_time" Claim semantically corresponds to the OpenID 2.0
      PAPE "auth_time" response parameter.)

   ID Tokens MUST be signed using JWS [JWS] and OPTIONALLY both signed
   and encrypted using JWS [JWS] and JWE [JWE] respectively, thereby
   providing authentication, integrity, non-repudiation and/or
   confidentiality (Section 8.13).

   Clients SHOULD directly validate the ID Token per ID Token
   Verification (Section 5.2).  Clients that do not understand the ID
   Token format or that do not wish to directly process ID Tokens MAY
   treat them as opaque values and submit them to the Check ID Endpoint
   (Section 2.3) for verification and decryption.

2.1.1.1.  User Identifier Types

   Provider's Discovery documents SHOULD list their supported identifier
   types in the "user_id_types_supported" element.

   If there is more than one type listed in the array, the Client MAY
   elect to provide its preferred identifier type using the
   "user_id_type" parameter during registration.

   The types supported by this specification are:

   public  This provides the same "user_id" value to all Clients.  It is
      the default if the provider has no "user_id_types_supported"
      element in its discovery document.

   pairwise  This provides a different "user_id" value to each Client,
      to prevent correlation of the user's activities by Clients without
      the user's permission.

2.1.1.1.1.  Pairwise Identifier Algorithm

   The Provider MUST calculate a unique "user_id" value for each Sector
   Identifier.

   If the Client has not provided a value for "sector_identifier_url" in
   registration, the Sector Identifier used for pairwise identifier
   calculation is the host component of the registered "redirect_uri".

   If there are multiple hostnames in the registered "redirect_uris",
   the Client MUST register a "sector_identifier_url".  When a
   "sector_identifier_url" is provided, the host component of that URL
   is used as the Sector Identifier for the pairwise identifier
   calculation.

   The value of the "sector_identifier_url" must be a HTTPS URL that
   points to a JSON file containing an array of "redirect_uri" values.
   The values of the registered "redirect_uris" must be included in the

   elements of the array, or the registration MUST fail.

   A number of algorithms MAY be used by Providers to calculate the
   pairwise identifier.  This specification includes a simple example.

   For instance, the Sector Identifier can be concatenated with a local
   account ID and a salt value that is kept secret by the Provider.  The
   concatenated string is then hashed by an appropriate algorithm.

   Calculate "user_id" = SHA256 ( sector_identifier | local_account_id |
   salt ).

2.1.2.  Authorization Request

   Section 4.1.1 and 4.2.1 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2.0] defines the OAuth
   Authorization Request parameters.  In this specification, the values
   to the parameters are defined as follows.

   response_type  A space delimited, case sensitive list of ASCII string
      values.  Acceptable values include "code", "token", and
      "id_token".  The value MUST include "code" for requesting an
      Authorization Code, "token" for requesting an Access Token, and
      "id_token" for requesting an ID Token.

   scope  A space delimited, case sensitive list of ASCII string values.
      The values specify an additive list of Claims that are returned by
      the UserInfo Endpoint.  The following values are defined:

      openid  REQUIRED.  Informs the Authorization Server that the
         Client is making an OpenID Connect request.  If the "openid"
         scope value is not present, the request MUST NOT be treated as
         an OpenID Connect request.  The "openid" value also requests
         that the ID Token associated with the authentication session be
         returned.  If the "response_type" includes "token", the ID
         Token is returned in the Authorization Response along with the
         Access Token.  If the "response_type" includes "code", the ID
         Token is returned as part of the Token Endpoint response.  This
         scope value requests access to the "user_id" Claim at the
         UserInfo Endpoint.

      profile  OPTIONAL.  This requests that access to the End-User's
         profile Claims (Table 1) excluding the "address" and "email"
         Claims at the UserInfo Endpoint be granted by the issued Access
         Token.

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


      email  OPTIONAL.  This requests that access to the "email" and
         "verified" Claims at the UserInfo Endpoint be granted by the
         issued Access Token.

      address  OPTIONAL.  This requests that access to "address" Claim
         at the UserInfo Endpoint be granted by the issued Access Token.

      phone  OPTIONAL.  This requests that access to the "phone_number"
         Claim at the UserInfo Endpoint be granted by the issued Access
         Token.

   Other REQUIRED OAuth 2.0 parameters in the request include:

   client_id  The OAuth 2.0 Client Identifier.

   redirect_uri  A redirection URI where the response will be sent.

   The request MAY contain the following OAuth 2.0 parameters:

   state  RECOMMENDED.  An opaque value used to maintain state between
      the request and the callback; it can serve as a protection against
      XSRF attacks, among other uses.

   The following extension parameters are also defined:

   nonce  REQUIRED.  A random, unique string value used to mitigate
      replay attacks.

   display  OPTIONAL.  An ASCII string value that specifies how the
      Authorization Server displays the authentication and consent user
      interface pages to the End-User.

      page  The Authorization Server SHOULD display authentication and
         consent UI consistent with a full user-agent page view.  If the
         display parameter is not specified this is the default display
         mode.

      popup  The Authorization Server SHOULD display authentication and
         consent UI consistent with a popup user-agent window.  The
         popup user-agent window SHOULD be 450 pixels wide and 500
         pixels tall.

      touch  The Authorization Server SHOULD display authentication and
         consent UI consistent with a device that leverages a touch
         interface.  The Authorization Server MAY attempt to detect the
         touch device and further customize the interface.





Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 11]

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


      wap  The Authorization Server SHOULD display authentication and
         consent UI consistent with a "feature phone" type display.

      embedded  The Authorization Server SHOULD display authentication
         and consent UI consistent with the limitations of an embedded
         user-agent.

   prompt  OPTIONAL.  A space delimited, case sensitive list of ASCII
      string values that specifies whether the Authorization Server
      prompts the End-User for reauthentication and consent.  The
      possible values are:

      none  The Authorization Server MUST NOT display any authentication
         or consent user interface pages.  An error is returned if the
         End-User is not already authenticated or the Client does not
         have pre-configured consent for the requested "scopes".  This
         can be used as a method to check for existing authentication
         and/or consent.

      login  The Authorization Server MUST prompt the End-User for
         reauthentication.

      consent  The Authorization Server MUST prompt the End-User for
         consent before returning information to the Client.

      select_account  The Authorization Server MUST prompt the End-User
         to select a user account.  This allows a user who has multiple
         accounts at the Authorization Server to select amongst the
         multiple accounts that they may have current sessions for.

      The "prompt" parameter can be used by the Client to make sure that
      the End-User is still present for the current session or to bring
      attention to the request.  If this parameter contains "none" with
      any other value, an error is returned.

   request  OPTIONAL.  A JWT [JWT] encoded OpenID Request Object
      (Section 2.1.2.1).

   request_uri  OPTIONAL.  An URL that points to an OpenID Request
      Object.  This is used to pass an OpenID Request Object by
      reference.

2.1.2.1.  OpenID Request Object

   The OpenID Request Object is used to provide OpenID request
   parameters that MAY differ from the default ones.  Implementing
   support for the OpenID Request Object is OPTIONAL.  Supporting it is
   necessary for implementations that need to request or provide sets of



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 12]

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


   Claims other than the default UserInfo (Section 2.4), and ID Token
   Claim sets.

   The OpenID Request Object is a JWT [JWT] that is passed as the value
   of the ""request"" parameter in the Authorization Request.  The
   OpenID Request Object can also be sent by reference.  Parameters that
   affect the information returned from the UserInfo Endpoint are in the
   ""userinfo"" member.  Parameters that affect the information returned
   in the ID Token are in the ""id_token"" member.  If the same
   parameters are present both in the Authorization Request and in the
   OpenID Request Object, the latter takes precedence.

   The OpenID Request Object MUST contain all REQUIRED OAuth 2.0
   Authorization Request parameters and MAY contain OPTIONAL and
   extension OAuth 2.0 parameters.  The OAuth 2.0 parameter values
   included MUST match the actual OAuth 2.0 request parameters used.

   The OpenID Request Object MAY contain a set of members defined by
   this specification and MAY contain other members that are not defined
   by this specification.  With only one exception, OpenID Request
   Object members MUST be understood by both parties; that exception is
   that OpenID Providers MAY ignore requests for Claims they can not
   provide or do not understand; however, Relying Parties MAY also
   consider it an error condition if all requested required Claims are
   not provided.

   The OpenID Request Object JWT MAY be signed or unsigned (plaintext).
   When it is a plaintext JWT, this is indicated by use of the JWT
   ""alg":"none"" convention in the JWT header.  If signed, the OpenID
   Request Object SHOULD contain the standard JWT ""iss"" (issuer) and
   ""aud"" (audience) Claims.

   The OpenID Request Object members defined by this specification are:

   userinfo  OPTIONAL.  (UserInfo request): Requests affecting the
      values to be returned from the UserInfo Endpoint.  If not present,
      the UserInfo Endpoint behaves in the default manner.

   id_token  OPTIONAL.  (ID Token request): Requests affecting the
      values to be to be returned in the ID Token.  If not present, the
      default ID Token contents are used.  If present, these parameters
      are used to request additional Claims incremental to the default
      Claims of the ID Token. (Section 2.1.1)

   An example OpenID Request Object body before JWT encoding is as
   follows:
   {
    "response_type": "code id_token",
    "client_id": "s6BhdRkqt3",
    "redirect_uri": "https://client.example.com/cb",
    "scope": "openid profile",
    "state": "af0ifjsldkj",
    "userinfo":
      {
        "claims":
          {
            "name": null,
            "nickname": {"optional": true},
            "email": null,
            "verified": null,
            "picture": {"optional": true}
          }
      },
    "id_token":
      {
        "claims":
          {
           "auth_time": null,
           "acr": { "values":["2"] }
          },
        "max_age": 86400,

      }
   }

2.1.2.1.1.  "userinfo" member

   The structure of the "userinfo" (UserInfo Request) member is a JSON
   object that MAY contain the following members:

   claims  OPTIONAL.  (Requested Claims): A JSON object containing a set
      of Claims being requested from the UserInfo Endpoint.  If not
      present, the UserInfo Claims held by the OP that are specified by
      the "scope" values used are returned.

   preferred_locales  OPTIONAL.  A list of preferred languages and
      scripts for the entire Claims request, represented as a JSON array
      of BCP47 [RFC5646] language tag values, ordered by preference.

   All members of the "userinfo" object are OPTIONAL.  Other members MAY
   be present and if so, SHOULD understood by both parties.

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


2.1.2.1.1.1.  "claims" member

   The "claims" member is a JSON object with a member for each requested
   Claim.  The member names are the requested Claim names.  The member
   values MAY be either:

   null  This indicates that this Claim is being requested in the
      default manner.  In particular, this is a required Claim.

   A JSON Object  This is used to provide additional information about
      the Claim being requested.

   The Claims MAY be represented in multiple languages and scripts.  To
   specify languages and scripts for the Claim request, BCP47 [RFC5646]
   language tags delimited by a "#" MUST be added to each requested
   Claim Name for which a particular language and script is requested.
   For example, the Claim "family_name#ja-Kana-JP" is used for
   expressing Family Name in Katakana in Japanese, which is commonly
   used to index and represent the phonetics of the Kanji representation
   of the same value represented as "family_name#ja-Hani-JP".

   All members of the "claims" object are OPTIONAL.

2.1.2.1.1.1.1.  Requested Claims Member

   The members defined by this specification for the JSON object value
   following a Claim Name member are:

   optional  This is an OPTIONAL Claim parameter.  If present, its value
      MUST be "true", which indicates that it is an optional Claim.  If
      it is not present, it is a required Claim.

   Other members MAY be defined to provide additional information about
   the requested Claim.  If the "claims" member is present in the
   "userinfo" object, the Claims requested within it override the Claim
   set that would otherwise be returned from the UserInfo Endpoint.

2.1.2.1.2.  "id_token" member

   The structure and function of the "id_token" (ID Token request)
   member of the OpenID Request Object is similar to that of the
   "userinfo" member.  It MAY include the OPTIONAL "claims" and
   "preferred_locales" members.  The structure of these members is the
   same as that for the "userinfo" member.  If the "claims" member is
   present in the "id_token" object, the Claims requested within it
   modify the Claim set that would otherwise be returned in the ID
   Token.  Unlike for the "userinfo" member, typically these Claims will
   augment, rather than override the default set.



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 15]

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


   Following Claims MAY be requested in the ID Token by specifying it in
   the "claims" member:

   user_id  OPTIONAL.  (User Identifier): The User Identifier for which
      an ID Token is being requested.  If the specified user is not
      currently authenticated to the Authorization Server, they may be
      prompted for authenticated, unless the "prompt" parameter in the
      Authorization Request is set to "none".  The Claim Value in the
      request is an object containing the single element "value".
    "user_id": {"value":"248289761001"}

   auth_time  OPTIONAL. (authenticated at): Requests that the
      "auth_time" Claim be present in the "id_token" (Section 2.1.1)
      response.  The Claim Value in the request is "null".

   acr  OPTIONAL.  (Authentication Context Class Reference): Requests
      the desired Authentication Context Class References.  The element
      "values" is an ordered array of strings representing acceptable
      Authentication Context Class Reference values appearing in order
      of preference.
    "acr": {"values":["2","http://id.incommon.org/assurance/bronze"]}

   In addition to the "claims" member, these additional members are
   defined within the "id_token" member of the OpenID Request Object:

   max_age  OPTIONAL. (max authentication age): Specifies that the End-
      User must be actively authenticated if any present authentication
      is older than the specified number of seconds.  (The "max_age"
      request parameter corresponds to the OpenID 2.0 PAPE
      "max_auth_age" request parameter.)

   It is anticipated that additional "id_token" parameters MAY be
   defined to request that additional properties hold for the
   authentication - for instance, that certain authentication policies
   be applied (in the same spirit of the OpenID 2.0 PAPE "auth_policies"
   values), or that the authentication conform to the policies defined
   by a specified trust framework.  These parameters MAY be defined by
   extension specifications.

   All members of the "id_token" object are OPTIONAL.  Other members MAY
   be present and if so, SHOULD be understood by both parties.

2.1.3.  Authorization Response

   When the "response_type" in the request is "token", the Authorization
   Response MUST return the parameters defined in section 4.2.2 of OAuth
   2.0 [OAuth2.0].  This specification only supports Bearer Tokens
   [OAuth.Bearer].  The OAuth 2.0 response parameter ""token_type"" MUST



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 16]

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


   be set to ""Bearer"".

   When the "response_type" in the request is "code", the Authorization
   Response MUST return the parameters defined in section 4.1.2 of OAuth
   2.0 [OAuth2.0].

   When the "response_type" includes other values, they must be returned
   as defined by their registration.  The "id_token" return type is
   defined in OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices
   [OAuth.Responses].

2.1.4.  Authorization Error Response

   If the End-User denies the access request or if the request fails,
   the Authorization Server informs the Client by returning parameters
   defined in sections 4.1.2.1 and 4.2.2.1 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2.0].

   In addition to the error codes defined in section 4.1.2.1 and 4.2.2.1
   of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2.0], this specification defines the following
   error codes:

   invalid_request_redirect_uri  The "redirect_uri" in the Authorization
      Request does not match any of the Client's pre-registered
      "redirect_uris".

   login_required  The Authorization Server requires End-User
      authentication.  This error MAY be returned when the "prompt"
      parameter in the Authorization Request is set to "none" to request
      that the Authorization Server should not display any user
      interfaces to the End-User, but the Authorization Request cannot
      be completed without displaying a user interface for user
      authentication.

   session_selection_required  The End-User is required to select a
      session at the Authorization Server.  The End-User MAY be
      authenticated at the Authorization Server with different
      associated accounts, but the End-User did not select a session.
      This error MAY be returned when the "prompt" parameter in the
      Authorization Request is set to "none" to request that the
      Authorization Server should not display any user interfaces to the
      End-User, but the Authorization Request cannot be completed
      without displaying a user interface to prompt for a session to
      use.

   consent_required  The Authorization Server requires End-User consent.
      This error MAY be returned when the "prompt" parameter in the
      Authorization Request is set to "none" to request that the
      Authorization Server should not display any user interfaces to the



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 17]

      End-User, but the Authorization Request cannot be completed
      without displaying a user interface for End-User consent.

   user_mismatched  The current logged in End-User at the Authorization
      Server does not match the requested user.  This error MAY be
      returned when the "prompt" parameter in the Authorization Request
      is set to "none" to request that the Authorization Server should
      not display any user interfaces to the End-User, but the
      Authorization Request cannot be completed without displaying a
      user interface to prompt for the correct End-User authentication.

   invalid_request_uri  The "request_uri" in the Authorization Request
      returns an error or invalid data.

   invalid_openid_request_object  The "request" parameter contains an
      invalid OpenID Request Object.

   Errors are returned as defined by the registered OAuth 2.0
   "response_type".

2.2.  Token Endpoint

   The Client sends an Access Token Request to the Token Endpoint to
   obtain Access Token Response, which MAY include Access Token, Refresh
   Token (Section 9.1), ID Token (Section 2.1.1), and other variables.

2.2.1.  Client Authentication

   During Client Registration, the Client MAY register an authentication
   method.  If no method is registered, the default method of
   "client_secret_basic" MUST be used.

   The Supported options are:

   client_secret_basic  Clients in possession of a client password
      authenticate with the Authorization Server in accordance with
      section 3.2.1 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2.0] using HTTP Basic
      authentication scheme.

   client_secret_post  Clients in possession of a client password
      authenticate with the Authorization Server in accordance with
      section 3.2.1 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2.0] by including the client
      credentials in the request body.

   client_secret_jwt  Clients in possession of a client password create
      a JWT using the HMAC-SHA algorithm.  The HMAC (Hash-based Message
      Authentication Code) is calculated using the "client_secret" as
      the shared key.  The client Authenticates in accordance with

      section 2.2 of (JWT) Bearer Token Profiles [OAuth.JWT] and OAuth
      2.0 Assertion Profile [OAuth.Assertions].  The JWT MUST contain
      the Claims:



      iss  REQUIRED.  The "iss" (issuer) Claim.  This MUST contain the
         "client_id" of the OAuth Client.

      prn  REQUIRED.  The "prn" (principal) Claim.  This MUST contain
         the "client_id" of the OAuth Client.

      aud  REQUIRED.  The "aud" (audience) Claim.  A value that
         identifies the Authorization Server as the intended audience.
         The Authorization Server MUST verify that it is an intended
         audience for the token.  The Audience SHOULD be the URL of the
         Authorization Server's Token Endpoint.

      jti  REQUIRED.  The "jti" (JWT ID) Claim.  A unique identifier for
         the token.  The JWT ID MAY be used by implementations requiring
         message de-duplication for one-time use assertions.

      exp  REQUIRED.  The "exp" (expiration) Claim that limits the time
         window during which the JWT can be used.

      iat  OPTIONAL.  The "iat" (issued at) Claim that identifies the
         time at which the JWT was issued.

      The authentication token MUST be sent as the value of the
      "client_assertion" parameter.

      The value of the "client_assertion_type" parameter MUST be
      "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer".

   private_key_jwt  Clients that have registered a public key sign a JWT
      using the RSA algorithm if a RSA key was registered or the ECDSA
      algorithm if an Elliptic Curve key was registered.  The Client
      Authenticates in accordance with section 2.2 of (JWT) Bearer Token
      Profiles [OAuth.JWT] and OAuth 2.0 Assertion Profile
      [OAuth.Assertions].  The JWT MUST contain the Claims:



      iss  REQUIRED.  The "iss" (issuer) Claim.  This MUST contain the
         "client_id" of the OAuth Client.

      prn  REQUIRED.  The "prn" (principal) Claim.  This MUST contain
         the "client_id" of the OAuth Client.

      aud  REQUIRED.  The "aud" (audience) Claim.  A value that
         identifies the Authorization Server as the intended audience.
         The Authorization Server MUST verify that it is an intended
         audience for the assertion.  The Audience SHOULD be the URL of
         the Authorization Server's Token Endpoint.

      jti  REQUIRED.  The "jti" (JWT ID) Claim.  A unique identifier for
         the token.  The token ID MAY be used by implementations
         requiring message de-duplication for one-time use assertions.

      exp  REQUIRED.  The "exp" (expiration) Claim that limits the time
         window during which the JWT can be used.

      iat  OPTIONAL.  The "iat" (issued at) Claim that identifies the
         time at which the JWT was issued.

      The authentication token MUST be sent as the value of the
      "client_assertion" parameter.

      The value of the "client_assertion_type" parameter MUST be
      "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer".

2.2.2.  Access Token Request

   The Client obtains an Access Token by authenticating with the
   Authorization Server and presenting its access grant (in the form of
   an Authorization Code, or Refresh Token).

   In addition to the Client authentication parameters, if this is a
   Refresh Token Request, the Client MUST send the additional parameters
   specified in Section 6 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2.0].  Otherwise the Client
   MUST send the request parameter for the Access Token Endpoint as
   specified in section 4.1.3 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2.0].

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


2.2.3.  Access Token Response

   After receiving and verifying a valid and authorized Access Token
   Request from the Client, the Authorization Server returns a
   successful response that includes an Access Token and an ID Token.
   The parameters in the successful response are defined in Section
   4.1.4 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2.0].

   This specification further constrains that only Bearer Tokens
   [OAuth.Bearer] are issued at the Token Endpoint.  The OAuth 2.0
   response parameter ""token_type"" MUST be set to ""Bearer"".

   In addition to the OAuth 2.0 response parameters, the following
   parameters MUST be included in the response if the Authorization
   Request "scope" parameter contains "openid":

   id_token  The ID Token value associated with the authentication
      session.

   Following is a non-normative example:
   {
    "access_token": "SlAV32hkKG",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "refresh_token": "8xLOxBtZp8",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "id_token": "eyJ0 ... NiJ9.eyJ1c ... I6IjIifX0.DeWt4Qu ... ZXso"
   }

   As in the OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2.0], Clients SHOULD ignore unrecognized
   response parameters.

2.2.4.  Token Error Response

   If the token request is invalid or unauthorized, the Authorization
   Server constructs the error response.  The parameters of the Token
   Error Response are defined as in Section 5.2 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2.0].

2.3.  Check ID Endpoint

   The Check ID Endpoint validates ID Tokens and returns a JSON
   [RFC4627] object that contains Claims about the authentication event
   associated with the supplied ID Token.

   Clients MUST not send encrypted ID Token to the Check ID Endpoint.
   If the Client registers "id_token_encrypted_response_algs" during
   OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 [OpenID.Registration],
   the Client must decrypt the ID Token, and SHOULD directly verify the
   ID Token per ID Token Verification (Section 5.2).

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


   This endpoint can be used by Clients that are not able to or do not
   wish to directly handle ID Tokens.  In such cases, Clients MAY treat
   the ID Token as an opaque value, and use the Check ID Endpoint to
   retrieve and examine the Claims associated with the ID Token.

2.3.1.  Check ID Request

   To request the information about the authentication performed on the
   End-User, Clients MAY send requests with the following parameter to
   the Check ID Endpoint:

   access_token  REQUIRED.  The ID Token obtained from an OpenID Connect
      Authorization Request.

2.3.2.  Check ID Response

   The response is a JSON [RFC4627] object containing the ID Token
   (Section 2.1.1) Claims.

   Other Claims MAY be requested by specifying the desired ID Token
   Claims to be returned in an OpenID Request Object (Section 2.1.2.1)
   when making an Authorization Request.

   The content-type of the response where applicable MUST be set to
   "application/json".

2.3.3.  Check ID Error Response

   When an error occurs, an error response is returned with an error
   code defined in Section 3.1 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens
   [OAuth.Bearer].

2.4.  UserInfo Endpoint

   The UserInfo Endpoint is a Protected Resource that returns Claims
   about the authenticated End-User.  Claims are represented by a JSON
   object that contains a collection of name and value pairs for the
   Claims.

2.4.1.  UserInfo Request

   Clients MAY send requests with the following parameters to the
   UserInfo Endpoint to obtain further information about the End-User.








Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 22]

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


   access_token  REQUIRED.  The Access Token obtained from an OpenID
      Connect Authorization Request.

   schema  REQUIRED.  The schema in which the data is to be returned.
      The only defined value is "openid".

   id This identifier is reserved.  It MUST be ignored by the endpoint
      when the "openid" schema is used.

2.4.2.  UserInfo Response

   If the requested schema is "openid", the response MUST return a JSON
   object that contains the full set or a subset of the Claims that are
   defined below.  Additional Claims (not specified below) MAY also be
   returned.

   If a Claim is not returned, that Claim Name SHOULD be omitted from
   the JSON object representing the Claims; it SHOULD NOT be present
   with a null or empty string value.

   The members MAY be represented in multiple languages and scripts.  To
   specify the languages and scripts, BCP47 [RFC5646] language tags MUST
   be added to each member names delimited by a "#", e.g.,
   "familyName#ja-Kana-JP" for expressing Family Name in Katakana in
   Japanese, which is commonly used to index and represent the phonetics
   of the Kanji representation of the same represented as
   "familyName#ja-Hani-JP".

   return Claims in JWT format, which can be signed and/or encrypted.
   The UserInfo Endpoint MUST return a content-type header to indicate
   the format that is being returned.  The following are accepted
   content types:

               +------------------+------------------------+
               | Content-Type     | Format Returned        |

    "email": "janedoe@example.com",
    "picture": "http://example.com/janedoe/me.jpg"
   }

2.4.2.1.  Address Claim

   The components of a physical mailing address.  Implementations MAY
   return only a subset of the fields of an "address", depending upon
   the information available and the End-User's privacy preferences.
   For example, the "country" and "region" might be returned without
   returning more fine-grained address information.

   Implementations MAY return just the full address as a single string
   in the formatted sub-field, or they MAY return just the individual
   component fields using the other sub-fields, or they MAY return both.
   If both variants are returned, they SHOULD be describing the same
   address, with the formatted address indicating how the component
   fields should be combined.

   formatted  The full mailing address, formatted for display or use
      with a mailing label.  This field MAY contain newlines.  This is
      the Primary Sub-Field for this field, for the purposes of sorting
      and filtering.

   street_address  The full street address component, which may include
      house number, street name, PO BOX, and multi-line extended street
      address information.  This field MAY contain newlines.

   locality  The city or locality component.

   region  The state, province, prefecture or region component.

   postal_code  The zip code or postal code component.

   country  The country name component.

2.4.3.  UserInfo Error Response

   When an error condition occurs, the UserInfo Endpoint returns an
   Error Response.  In addition to the error codes defined in section
   3.1 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens [OAuth.Bearer], this specification
   defines the following error codes:

   invalid_schema  The requested schema is invalid or unsupported.

2.5.  Claim Types

   The UserInfo Endpoint MAY return the following three types of Claims:

   Normal Claims  Claims that are directly asserted by the OpenID
      Provider.

   Aggregated Claims  Claims that are asserted by a Claims Provider
      other than the OpenID Provider but are returned by OpenID
      Provider.

   Distributed Claims  Claims that are asserted by a Claims Provider
      other than the OpenID Provider but are returned as references by
      the OpenID Provider.

   The UserInfo endpoint MUST support normal Claims.

   Aggregated and Distributed Claims support is OPTIONAL.

2.5.1.  Normal Claims

   Normal Claims are represented as members in a JSON object.  The Claim
   Name is the member name and the Claim Value is the member value.

   The following is a non-normative normal Claims response:

   {
    "name": "Jane Doe"
    "given_name": "Jane",
    "family_name": "Doe",
    "email": "janedoe@example.com",
    "picture": "http://example.com/janedoe/me.jpg"
   }

2.5.2.  Aggregated and Distributed Claims

   Aggregated and distributed Claims are represented by using special
   "_claim_names" and "_claim_sources" members of the JSON object
   containing the Claims.

   _claim_names  This value is a JSON object whose member names are the
      Claim Names for the Aggregated and Distributed Claims.  The member
      values are references to the member names in the "_claim_sources"
      member from which the actual Claim Values can be retrieved.

   _claim_sources  This value is a JSON object whose member names are
      referenced by the member values of the "_claim_names" member.  The
      member values contain sets of Aggregated Claims or reference
      locations for Distributed Claims.  The member values can have one
      of the following formats depending on whether it is providing
      Aggregated or Distributed Claims:

      Aggregated Claims  A JSON object that MUST contain the "JWT"
         member whose value is a JWT [JWT] that MUST contain all the
         Claims in the "_claim_names" object that references the
         corresponding "_claim_sources" member.  Other members MAY be
         present if they are understood by both parties.

         JWT  REQUIRED.  JWT Value.

      Distributed Claims  A JSON object that contains the following
         members and values:

         endpoint  REQUIRED.  The value is the OAuth 2.0 resource
            endpoint from which the associated Claim can be retrieved.
            The endpoint URL MUST return the Claim as a JWT.

         access_token  OPTIONAL.  Access Token enabling retrieval of the
            Claims from the endpoint URL by using the OAuth 2.0 Bearer
            [OAuth.Bearer] scheme.  Claims SHOULD be requested using the
            Authorization Request header field and Claims Sources MUST

            Clients MAY need to retrieve the Access Token out of band or
            use an a priori Access Token that was negotiated between the

            Claim Source and Client, or the Claim Source MAY
            reauthenticate the End-User and/or reauthorize the Client.

      Other members MAY be present, if understood by both parties.

   The following is a non-normative response with Aggregated Claims:

Claims Provider A contains the following Claims for Jane Doe:
{
 "address": {
   "street_address": "1234 Hollywood Blvd.",
   "locality": "Los Angeles",
   "region": "CA",
   "postal_code": "90210",
   "country": "US"},
 "phone_number": "+1 (310) 123-4567"
}

Claims Provider A signs the JSON Claims, resulting in a signed JWT:
jwt_header.jwt_part2.jwt_part3

Authorization Server returns Jane Doe's aggregated Claims from Claims Provider A:

3.  Serializations

   Parameter names and values MAY be JSON serialized into a JSON
   structure.

3.1.  JSON Serialization

   The parameters are serialized into a JSON structure by adding each
   parameter at the highest structure level.  Parameter names and string
   values are included as JSON strings.  Numerical values are included
   as JSON numbers.  Each parameter MAY have JSON Structure as its
   value.

   Following is a non-normative example of such serialization:
   {
    "access_token":"SlAV32hkKG",
    "expires_in":3600,
    "refresh_token":"8xLOxBtZp8"
   }

4.  Signatures and Encryption

   Depending on the transport through which the messages are sent, the
   integrity of the message may not be guaranteed and the originator of
   the message may not be authenticated.  To mitigate these risks,
   OpenID Connect messages MAY utilize JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS] to
   sign the content.

   To achieve message confidentiality, OpenID Connect messages MAY use
   JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [JWE] to encrypt the content.

   When the message is both signed and encrypted, it MUST be signed
   first then encrypted (Section 8.13).

4.1.  Supported Algorithms

   The server advertises its supported signing and encryption algorithms
   in its discovery document.  The related elements are:

   userinfo_algs_supported  A JSON array containing a list of the JWS
      [JWS] and JWE [JWE] signing and encryption algorithms supported by
      the UserInfo Endpoint.

   id_token_algs_supported  A JSON array containing a list of the JWS
      [JWS] and JWE [JWE] signing and encryption algorithms supported by
      the Authorization Server for the ID Token.

   request_object_algs_supported  A JSON array containing a list of the
      JWS [JWS] and JWE [JWE] signing and encryption algorithms
      supported by the Authorization Server for the OpenID Request
      Object (Section 2.1.2.1).  Servers SHOULD support "HS256".

   token_endpoint_auth_algs_supported  A JSON array containing a list of
      the JWS [JWS] signing algorithms supported by the Token Endpoint
      for the "private_key_jwt" method.  Servers SHOULD support "RS256".

   The Client registers its required algorithms for Signing and
   Encryption using the following Registration parameters:

   require_signed_request_object  OPTIONAL.  The JWS [JWS] signature
      algorithm that MUST be required by the Authorization Server.  All
      OpenID Request Objects from this "client_id" MUST be rejected if
      not signed by this algorithm.

   userinfo_signed_response_algs  OPTIONAL.  The JWS [JWS] signature
      algorithm required for userinfo responses.  If this is specified
      the response will be JWT [JWT] serialized.




Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 32]

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


   userinfo_encrypted_response_algs  OPTIONAL.  A space separated list
      of the JWE [JWE] "alg" and "enc" algorithms required for userinfo
      responses.  If this is requested in combination with signing, the
      response MUST be signed first then encrypted (Section 8.13).  If
      this is specified, the response will be JWT [JWT] serialized.

   id_token_signed_response_algs  OPTIONAL.  The JWS [JWS] signing
      algorithm required for "id_token" issued to this "client_id".  The
      default if not specified is "HS256" using the provided
      "client_secret" as the shared key.

   id_token_encrypted_response_algs  OPTIONAL.  A space separated list
      of the JWE [JWE] "alg" and "enc" algorithms required for
      "id_token" issued to this "client_id".  If this is requested the
      response MUST be signed then encrypted.  The default if not
      specified is no encryption.

4.2.  Keys

   The Server advertises its supported signing and encryption algorithms
   in its discovery document.  The related elements are:

   The Provider provides its public Keys during Discovery in the
   following elements:

   jwk_url  URL of the OP's JSON Web Key [JWK] document that contains
      the Server's signing key that is used for JWS signing the JWT.  It
      MAY also be used by the Client to JWE encrypt the JWT to the
      Server if "x509_encryption_url" or "jwk_encryption_url" is not
      specified, but this is discouraged.  A separate encryption key
      SHOULD be used.

   jwk_encryption_url  URL of the OP's JSON Web Key [JWK] document that
      contains the Server's encryption key that is used by the Client to
      JWE encrypt the JWT to the Server.  If it is not present, its
      value is the same as the URL provided by "jwk_url".

   x509_url  URL of the OP's X.509 certificates in PEM format that are
      used by the Server for Signing the JWT.  It MAY also be used by
      the Client to JWE Encrypt the JWT to the Server if
      "x509_encryption_url" is not specified and the key usage includes
      "keyEncipherment".

   x509_encryption_url  URL of the OP's X.509 certificates in PEM format
      that contains the Server's encryption key that is used by the
      Client to JWE encrypt the JWT to the Server.  If it is not
      present, the URL provided by the "x509_url" is used instead.  The
      certificate MUST include "keyEncipherment" in the key usage.



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 33]

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


   The Client provides its public Keys during Registration, in the
   following elements:

   jwk_url  OPTIONAL.  URL for the Client's JSON Web Key [JWK] document
      that is used for JWS [JWS] signing of the Request Objects.  If
      "jwk_encryption_url" is not provided, it is also used by the
      Server for JWE [JWE] encryption of JWT [JWT] to the Client.

   jwk_encryption_url  OPTIONAL.  URL for the Client's JSON Web Key
      [JWK].  It is used by the Server for JWE [JWE] encryption of the
      response objects.

   x509_url  OPTIONAL.  URL for the Client's PEM encoded X.509
      Certificate or Certificate chain.  It is used by the Client for
      JWS [JWS] signing of the request objects.  If
      "x509_encryption_url" is not present, it is also used for JWE
      [JWE] encryption of the JWT [JWT] to the Client if the key usage
      includes "keyEncipherment".

   x509_encryption_url  OPTIONAL.  URL for the Client's PEM encoded
      X.509 Certificate or Certificate chain, used for JWE [JWE]
      encryption of JWT [JWT] to the Client.

   If keys are specified in both x509 and jwk, they MUST be the same
   keys.

   Key algorithms like Elliptic Curve signing and key agreement require
   separate keys for signing and encryption for security.  For RSA a
   single key MAY be used for both, but it is good practice to separate
   them.

4.3.  Signing

   The signing party MUST select a signature algorithm based on the
   supported algorithms of the recipient in Section 4.1.

   Symmetric Signatures  When using HMAC Signatures, the "alg" Claim of
      the JWS header MUST be set to the appropriate algorithm as defined
      in JSON Web Signature [JWS].  The "client_secret" MUST be used as
      the signature key.

   Asymmetric Signatures  When using RSA or ECDSA Signatures, the "alg"
      Claim of the JWS header MUST be set to the appropriate algorithm
      as defined in JSON Web Signature [JWS].  The private key MUST be
      the one associated with the Public Signing Key provided in
      Section 4.2.  If there are multiple keys in the referenced JWK
      document, the "kid" MUST be specified in the JWS header.  If there
      are multiple certificates at the referenced certificate location,



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 34]

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


      then "x5t" MUST be specified in the JWS header.  The key usage of
      the respective keys MUST include signature.  In particular, if the
      key found through "x5u" is used, the key usage MUST include
      "digitalSignature".

4.4.  Encryption

   The encrypting party MUST select an encryption algorithm based on the
   supported algorithms of the recipient in Section 4.1.

   All JWT MUST be signed before encryption to provide integrity and to
   verify the Issuer.

   Symmetric Encryption algorithms that provide an integrated integrity
   check MUST be used if supported by both the sender and receiver.  The
   "A128GCM" and "A256GCM" algorithms support this.

   Symmetric Encryption  Use the "client_secret" to KeyWrap a random
      "Content Encryption Key" to be used for encrypting the signed JWT.

   Asymmetric Encryption RSA  Use the link registered/discovered in
      Section 4.2 to retrieve the relevant key.  The
      "jwk_encryption_url" or "x509_encryption_url" link MUST be used if
      provided.  If there are multiple keys in the referenced JWK
      document, the "kid" MUST be specified in the JWS header.  If there
      are multiple certificates at the referenced certificate location,
      then "x5t" MUST be specified in the JWS header.  Use the supported
      RSA KeyWrap algorithm to KeyWrap a random "Content Encryption Key"
      to be used for encrypting the signed JWT.  The key usage of the
      respective keys MUST include encryption.  In particular, if the
      key found through "x5u" is used, the key usage MUST include
      "keyEncipherment".

   Asymmetric Encryption Elliptic Curve  Create an ephemeral Elliptic
      Curve public key for the "epk" element of the JWE header.  Use the
      link registered/discovered in Section 4.2 to retrieve the relevant
      key.  The "jwk_encryption_url" or "x509_encryption_url" link MUST
      be used if provided.  If there are multiple keys in the referenced
      JWK document, the "kid" MUST be specified in the JWE header.  If
      there are multiple certificates at the referenced certificate
      location, then "x5t" MUST be specified in the JWS header.  Use the
      ECDH-ES algorithm to KeyWrap a random "Content Encryption Key" to
      be used for encrypting the signed JWT.  The key usage of the
      respective keys MUST include encryption.  In particular, if the
      key found through "x5u" is used, the key usage MUST include
      "keyEncipherment".

5.  Verification

5.1.  Authorization Request Verification

   Authorization Request Verification consists of two main steps. (1)
   Encryption and Signature validation of the value of "request" or the
   content of "request_uri", (2) Parameter verification.

   If an OpenID Request Object was sent in the "request" parameter or by
   reference in the "request_uri" parameter, the Request Object MUST
   verify as JWS [JWS] or JWE [JWE] objects that are encoded in the JWT
   [JWT].

5.1.1.  Encrypted Request Object

   If the Authorization Server has advertised JWE encryption algorithms
   in the "request_object_algs_supported" element of its Discovery
   Document, these are used by the Client to JWE encrypt the JWT.

   The Authorization Server MUST decode the JWT in accordance with JSON
   Web Encryption [JWE] specification.  The result MAY be either OpenID
   Request Object or a JWS Signed JWT.  In the latter case, the
   signature verification MUST be performed as defined in Signed Request
   Object (Section 5.1.2).

   The Authorization Server MUST return the error if there is a
   decryption error.

5.1.2.  Signed Request Object

   To perform Signature Verification, the "alg" parameter in the JWT
   header MUST match the value of the "require_signed_request_object"
   set during Client Registration [OpenID.Registration] or otherwise
   pre-registered value.

   The signature must be validated against the key registered for that
   "client_id" and algorithm, in accordance with the JSON Web Signature
   [JWS] specification.

   The Authorization Server MUST return the error authorization response
   if there is a signature validation error.

5.1.3.  Parameter Verification

   The Authorization Server MUST construct the Authorization Request
   Message from the OpenID Request Object and other parameters.  Note
   that if the same parameter exists both in the OpenID Request Object
   and other parameters, the former takes precedence.  Using this



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 36]

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


   Authorization Request Message, the Authorization Server performs the
   following steps of the request verification:

   1.  The Authorization Server MUST understand all the parameters
       except for the unsupported Claims.  If there is any parameters
       that it does not understand except for the unsupported Claims, it
       MUST return an error response.

   2.  The Authorization Server MUST verify that all the OAuth 2.0
       variables according to OAuth 2.0.

   3.  The Authorization Server MUST verify that all the required
       parameters are present.

   4.  If the "user_id" Claim as a member of "id_token" element is
       requested with a specific value, the Authorization Server MUST
       only send a positive response if that user has an active session
       with the authorization server.  The Authorization server MUST not
       reply with an ID Token or Access Token for a different user, even
       if they have an active session with the Authorization Server.

   5.  If the "acr" Claim is requested as a required Claim in the
       "id_token" member with "values" as a parameter, the Authorization
       Server MUST return an "acr" Claim value that matches one of the
       requested values.  The Authorization server MAY ask the user to
       re-authenticate with additional factors to meet the requirements.
       If this is a required Claim and the requirement cannot be met,
       then the Authorization Server MUST return an error.  The Client
       MAY make this Claim optional by including "optional": true in the
       "acr" Claim request.  If the Claim is optional and the requested
       value for the user cannot be provided, the Authorization server
       SHOULD return the session's current "acr" as the value of the
       "acr" Claim.  If the Claim is optional, the Authorization server
       is not required to provide this Claim in its response.

   If the Authorization Server encounters any error, it MUST return the
   error response.

5.2.  ID Token Verification

   To verify the validity of ID Token in the Authorization or Token
   Endpoint Response, the Client MUST do the following:

   1.   If the Client has provided an "id_token_encrypted_response_algs"
        parameter during Registration, decrypt the id_token [JWE], using
        the key pair specified during Registration.





Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 37]

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


   2.   The Client MUST validate that the "client_id" in the "aud"
        (audience) Claim is one it has registered for the Issuer
        identified by the value in the "iss" (issuer) Claim.  The ID
        Token MUST be rejected if the value of "aud" (audience) is not
        valid for the Issuer.

   3.   The Client MUST verify the ID Token signature according to
        Section 5 of JWS [JWS] using the algorithm specified in the
        "alg" parameter of the JWT header.

   4.   The value of "alg" SHOULD be the algorithm sent by the Client in
        the "id_token_signed_response_algs" parameter during
        Registration.

   5.   If the "alg" parameter of the JWT header is one of "HS256",
        "HS384", or "HS512", the "client_secret" for the "client_id"
        contained in the "aud" (audience) Claim is used to validate the
        signature.

   6.   For other Signing algorithms the Client must use the signing key
        provided in Discovery by the Issuer exactly matching the value
        of the "iss" (issuer) Claim.

   7.   The current time MUST be less than the value of the "exp" Claim.

   8.   The value of the "nonce" Claim MUST be checked to verify that it
        is the same value as the one that was sent in the Authorization
        Request.  The Client SHOULD check the "nonce" value for replay
        attacks.  The precise method for detecting replay attacks is
        Client specific.

   9.   If the "acr" Claim was requested, the Client SHOULD check that
        the asserted Claim Value is appropriate.  The meaning and
        processing of "acr" Claim Values is out of scope for this
        specification.

   10.  If the "auth_time" Claim was requested, the Client SHOULD check
        the value and request re-authentication if it determines too
        much time has elapsed since the last user authentication.

5.3.  Check ID Request Verification

   The Authorization Server MUST check that the "access_token" is
   present in the request and if it is signed, it MUST verify the
   signature according to Section 5 of JWS [JWS].

   If the JWS algorithm is symmetric, such as the default "HS256" for
   "id_token", the "client_secret" for the "client_id" contained in the



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 38]

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


   "aud" (audience) Claim MUST be used to validate the signature.

   The Authorization Server MUST check that the "id_token" provided as
   the "access_token" contains all REQUIRED Claims.

5.4.  Check ID Response Verification

   If the Client does not directly verify the ID Token signature, it
   MUST make a request to the Check ID Endpoint to validate the ID
   Token.

   To verify the validity of the Token response, the Client MUST do the
   following:

   1.  Check that the OP that responded was really the intended OP.

   2.  The Client MUST validate that the "client_id" in the "aud"
       (audience) Claim is one it has registered for the Issuer
       identified by the value in the "iss" (issuer) Claim.  The ID
       Token MUST be rejected if the value of "aud" (audience) is not
       valid for the Issuer.

   3.  The value of the "iss" (issuer) Claim must match the Issuer for
       the Check ID Endpoint"

   4.  The current time MUST be less than the value of the "exp" Claim.

   5.  The value of the "nonce" Claim MUST be checked to verify that it
       is the same value as the one that was sent in the Authorization
       Request.  The Client SHOULD check the "nonce" value for replay
       attacks.  The precise method for detecting replay attacks is
       Client specific.

   6.  If the "acr" Claim was requested, the Client SHOULD check that
       the asserted Claim Value is appropriate.  The meaning and
       processing of "acr" Claim Values is out of scope for this
       specification.

   7.  If the "auth_time" Claim was requested, the Client SHOULD check
       the value and request re-authentication if it determines too much
       time has elapsed since the last user authentication.

   8.  The Check ID Endpoint has not returned an error for the ID Token
       being expired or invalid.

   9.  Check that the "iss" (issuer) is equal to that of the pre-
       configured or discovered Issuer Identifier for the user session.

5.5.  UserInfo Response Verification

   To verify the validity of the UserInfo response, the Client MUST do
   the following:

   1.  If the Client has provided a "userinfo_encrypted_response_algs"
       parameter during Registration, decrypt the id_token [JWE], using
       the key pair specified during Registration.

   2.  If the response was signed, the Client SHOULD validate the
       signature according to Section 5 of JWS [JWS].

   3.  Check that the OP that responded was really the intended OP
       through a TLS/SSL server certificate check, per RFC 6125

6.  String Operations

   Processing some OpenID Connect messages requires comparing values in
   the messages to known values.  For example, the Claim Names returned
   by the UserInfo Endpoint might be compared to specific Claim Names
   such as "user_id".  Comparing Unicode strings, however, has
   significant security implications.

   Therefore, comparisons between JSON strings and other Unicode strings
   MUST be performed as specified below:

   1.  Remove any JSON applied escaping to produce an array of Unicode
       code points.

   2.  Unicode Normalization [USA15] MUST NOT be applied at any point to
       either the JSON string or to the string it is to be compared
       against.

   3.  Comparisons between the two strings MUST be performed as a
       Unicode code point to code point equality comparison.

   In several places, this specification uses space delimited lists of
   strings.  In all such cases, only the ASCII space character (0x20)
   MAY be used for this purpose.

7.  Related Specifications

   This specification is an abstract specification.  It needs to be
   bound to a protocol to be used in practice.  One such example of
   protocol binding is:

   o  OpenID Connect Standard 1.0 [OpenID.Standard] - Protocol binding
      for the full set of OpenID Connect messages

   These related OpenID Connect specifications MAY OPTIONALLY be used in
   combination with this specification to provide additional
   functionality:

   o  OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 [OpenID.Discovery] - Dynamic
      discovery for user and Authorization Server endpoints and
      information

   o  OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0
      [OpenID.Registration] - Dynamic registration of OpenID Connect
      Clients with OpenID Providers

   o  OpenID Connect Basic Client 1.0 [OpenID.Basic] - Protocol binding
      for a subset of the OpenID Connect Messages that is intended for
      use by basic Relying Parties.

   o  OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 [OpenID.Session] - Session
      management for OpenID Connect sessions

8.  Security Considerations

   OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security Considerations [OAuth.Threat]
   provides an extensive list of threats and controls that applies to
   this standard as well.  In addition, this standard provides
   additional control measures listed below.

8.1.  Request Disclosure

   If appropriate measures are not taken, a request may be disclosed to
   an attacker posing security and privacy threat.

   In addition to what is stated in section 5.1.1 of the [OAuth.Threat],
   this standard provides a way to provide the confidentiality of the
   request end to end through the use of "request" or "request_uri"
   parameters, where the content of the "request" is an encrypted JWT
   with the appropriate key and cipher.  This works even against a
   compromised user-agent in the case of indirect request.

8.2.  Server Masquerading

   A malicious Server may masquerade as the legitimate server using
   various means.  To detect such an attack, the Client needs to
   authenticate the server.

   In addition to what is stated in section 5.1.2 of the [OAuth.Threat],
   this standard provides a way to authenticate the Server through
   either the use of Signed or Encrypted JWT (JWS and JWE) with an
   appropriate key and cipher.

8.3.  Token Manufacture/Modification

   An Attacker may generate a bogus token or modify the token content
   (such as the authentication or attribute statements) of an existing
   parseable token, causing the RP to grant inappropriate access to the
   Client.  For example, an Attacker may modify the parseable token to
   extend the validity period; a Client may modify the parseable token
   to have access to information that they should not be able to view.

   There are two ways to mitigate this attack:

   1.  The token can be digitally signed by the OP.  The Relying Party
       SHOULD check the digital signature to verify that it was issued
       by a legitimate OP.

   2.  The token can be sent over a protected channel such as TLS 1.2
       RFC 5246 [RFC5246] and/or TLS 1.0 [RFC2246].  In order to protect
       the integrity of the token from malicious attack, the Server MUST



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 43]

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


       be authenticated, per RFC 6125 [RFC6125].  In this specification,
       the token is always sent over TLS/SSL protected channel.  Note
       however, that this measure is only applicable to the third party
       attacker and is not applicable to the case where the Client is
       the attacker.

8.4.  Server Response Disclosure

   Server response may contain authentication and attribute statements
   that include sensitive Client information.  Disclosure of the
   response contents can make the Client vulnerable to other types of
   attacks.

   The server response disclosure can be mitigated in the following two
   ways:

   1.  Using the "code" response type.  The response is sent over a TLS/
       SSL protected channel, where the Client is authenticated by the
       "client_id" and "client_secret".

   2.  For other response types, the signed response can be encrypted
       with the Client's public key or a shared secret as an encrypted
       JWT (JWE) with an appropriate key and cipher.

8.5.  Server Response Repudiation

   A response may be repudiated by the server if the proper mechanisms
   are not in place.  For example, if a Server does not digitally sign a
   response, the Server can claim that it was not generated through the
   services of the Server.

   To mitigate this threat, the response may be digitally signed by the
   Server using a key that supports non-repudiation.  The Client SHOULD
   check the digital signature to verify that it was issued by a
   legitimate Server and the integrity is intact.

8.6.  Request Repudiation

   Since it is possible for a compromised or malicious Client to send
   request to a wrong party, a Client that was authenticated using only
   a bearer token can repudiate any transaction.

   To mitigate this threat, the Sever MAY require that the request to be
   digitally signed by the Client using a key that supports non-
   repudiation.  The Server SHOULD check the digital signature to verify
   that it was issued by a legitimate Client and the integrity is
   intact.

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


8.7.  Access Token Redirect

   An Attacker uses the access token generated for one resource to
   obtain access to a second resource.

   To mitigate this threat, the access token should be audience and
   scope restricted.  One way of implementing it is to include the
   identifier of the resource for whom it was generated as audience.
   The resource verifies that incoming tokens include its identifier as
   the audience of the token.

8.8.  Token Reuse

   An Attacker attempts to use a one-time use token such as an
   Authorization Code that has been used once with the intended
   Resource.

   To mitigate this threat, the token SHOULD include a timestamp and a
   short lifetime of validity.  The Relying Party checks the timestamp
   and lifetime values to ensure that the token is currently valid.

   Alternatively, the server may record the state of the use of the
   token and check the status for each request.

8.9.   Eavesdropping or leaking authorization codes (Secondary
      Authenticator Capture)

   In addition to the attack patterns described in 4.4.1.1 of OAuth SC,
   it can be captured in the User-Agent where the TLS session is
   terminated if the User-Agent is infested by malware.

   However, capturing it is not useful as long as the profile uses
   either Client authentication or the Response encryption.

8.10.  Token Substitution

   A user may attempt to impersonate a more privileged user by
   subverting the communication channel between the Token Endpoint and
   Client, for example by reordering the messages, to convince the Token
   Endpoint that his or her authorization grant corresponds to the grant
   sent on behalf of the more privileged user.

   Responses to token requests is bound to the corresponding requests by
   message order in HTTP, as both token and requests are protected by
   TLS that can detect and disallow malicious reordering of packets.

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


8.11.  Timing Attack

   Timing attack is an attack that allows the attacker to obtain
   unnecessary large amount of information through the elapse time
   difference in the code path taken by a successful decryption and
   unsuccessful verification of signed message.  It can be used to
   reduce the effective key length of the cipher used.

   Implementations should not terminate the verification process at the
   instance of the finding error but should continue running until all
   the octets were processed to avoid this attack.

8.12.  Other Crypto Related Attacks

   There are various crypto related attacks possible depending on the
   method used for encryption and signature / integrity checking.

   Implementation should consult the security consideration around the
   JWS [JWS], JWE [JWE] and JWT [JWT] to avoid the vulnerability around
   these specifications.

8.13.  Signing and Encryption order

   Signatures over encrypted text are not considered valid in many
   jurisdictions.  For the integrity of non-repudiation this
   specification requires signing of the plain text JSON.

   It is however strongly RECOMMENDED that the selected Encryption
   algorithm include integrity to protect against padding oracle and
   other decryption attacks.

   Implementation should consult the security consideration around the
   JWE [JWE] to avoid the vulnerability around these specifications.

8.14.  Issuer Identifier

   OpenID Connect supports a single issuer per Host and Port
   combination.

   It is RECOMMENDED that only a single issuer per host be used.  Simple
   Web Discovery treats the path component of any URI as part of the
   user identifier.

8.15.  TLS Requirements

   Implementations MUST support TLS.  Which version(s) ought to be
   implemented will vary over time, and depend on the widespread
   deployment and known security vulnerabilities at the time of



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 46]

                 OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 - draft 07    December 2011


   implementation.  At the time of this writing, TLS version 1.2
   [RFC5246] is the most recent version, but has very limited actual
   deployment, and might not be readily available in implementation
   toolkits.  TLS version 1.0 [RFC2246] is the most widely deployed
   version, and will give the broadest interoperability.

   To protect against information disclosure and tampering,
   confidentiality protection MUST be applied using TLS with a
   ciphersuite that provides confidentiality and integrity protection.

9.  Privacy Considerations

   The UserInfo response typically contains Personally Identifiable
   Information.  As such, End-User consent for the release of the
   information for the specified purpose SHOULD be obtained at or prior
   to the authorization time in accordance with relevant regulations.
   The purpose of use is typically registered in association with the
   "redirect_uris".

   Only necessary UserInfo data should be stored at the Client and the
   Client SHOULD associate the received data with the purpose of use
   statement.

   The Resource Server SHOULD make the UserInfo access log available to
   the End-User so that the End-User can monitor who accessed his data.

   To protect the End-User from a possible correlation among Clients,
   the use of a Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID) as the "user_id"
   SHOULD be considered.

9.1.  Refresh Token, and Access Token Lifetime

   Access Token grants are not revocable by the Authorization Server.
   Access Token grant lifetimes SHOULD be kept to single use or very
   short lifetimes.

   If access to the User Info Endpoint or other protected resources is
   required, a Refresh Token should be used.  The Client may then
   exchange the Refresh Token at the Token Endpoint for a fresh short
   lived Access Token, that can be used to access the resource.

   The Authorization Server SHOULD clearly identify long term grants to
   the User during Authorization.

   The Authorization Server MUST provide a mechanisim for the user to
   revoke Refresh Tokens granted to a Client.
