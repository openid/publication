      OpenID Shared Signals Framework Specification 1.0 - draft 03
                   openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0

Abstract

   This Shared Signals Framework (SSF) enables sharing of signals and
   events between cooperating peers.  It enables multiple applications
   such as Risk Incident Sharing and Coordination (RISC) and the
   Continuous Access Evaluation Profile ([CAEP])

   This specification defines:

   *  A profile for Security Events Tokens [RFC8417]

   *  Subject principals

   *  Subject claims in SSF events

   *  Event types

   *  Event properties

   *  Transmitter Configuration Metadata and its discovery method for
      Receivers

   *  A management API for Event Streams

   This specification also directly profiles several IETF Security
   Events specifications:

   *  Security Event Token (SET) [RFC8417]

   *  Subject Identifiers for Security Event Tokens [RFC9493]

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Subject Principals

   This Shared Signals Framework specification defines a Subject
   Principal to be the entities about which an event can be sent by
   Transmitters and received by Receivers using the Shared Signals
   Framework.

   Subject Principals are the managed entities in an SSF Transmitter or
   Receiver.  These include human or robotic principals, devices,
   customer tenants in a multi-tenanted service, organizational units
   within a tenant, groups of subject principals, or other entities that
   are managed by Transmitters and Receivers.  There may be other actors

   or resources that can be treated as Subject Principals, and event-
   type definitions SHOULD specify the range of principals addressed by
   the event.

   Subject Principals are identified by Subject Members defined below.

3.  Subject Members in SSF Events

3.1.  Subject Members

   A Subject Member of an SSF event describes a subject of the event.  A
   top-level claim named sub_id MUST be used to describe the primary
   subject of the event.

3.1.1.  Existing CAEP and RISC Events

   Event types already defined in the CAEP ([CAEP]) and RISC ([RISC])
   specifications MAY use a subject field within the events claim of the
   SSF event to describe the primary Subject Principal of the event.
   SSF Transmitters MUST include the top-level sub_id claim even for
   these existing event types.

3.1.2.  New Event Types

   New event types MUST use the top-level sub_id claim and MUST NOT use
   the subject field in the events claim to describe the primary Subject
   Principal.

3.1.3.  Additional Subject Members

   Specific event types MAY define additional Subject Members if
   required to describe additional subjects of that event type (e.g. a
   Transferee).  These additional subject fields MAY have any field
   name.

3.1.4.  Subject Member Values

   Each Subject Member MUST refer to exactly one Subject Principal.  The
   value of a Subject Member MAY be a "simple subject" or a "complex
   subject".

3.2.  Simple Subject Members

   A Simple Subject Member has a claim name and a value that is a
   "Subject Identifier" as defined in the Subject Identifiers for
   Security Event Tokens [RFC9493].  Below is a non-normative example of
   a Simple Subject Member in an SSF event.

     "format": "email",
     "email": "foo@example.com"
   }

                     Figure 1: Example: Simple Subject

3.3.  Complex Subject Members

   A Complex Subject Member has a name and a value that is a JSON
   [RFC7159] object that has a format field, and one or more Simple
   Subject Members.  The name of the format field is "format", and its
   value is "complex".  The name of each Simple Subject Member in this
   value MAY be one of the following:

   user

      OPTIONAL.  A Subject Identifier that identifies a user.

   device

      OPTIONAL.  A Subject Identifier that identifies a device.

   session

      OPTIONAL.  A Subject Identifier that identifies a session.

   application

      OPTIONAL.  A Subject Identifier that identifies an application.

   tenant

      OPTIONAL.  A Subject Identifier that identifies a tenant.

   org_unit

      OPTIONAL.  A Subject Identifier that identifies an organizational
      unit.

   group

      OPTIONAL.  A Subject Identifier that identifies a group.

   Additional Subject Member names MAY be used in Complex Subjects.
   Each member name MAY appear at most once in the Complex Subject
   value.

   Below is a non-normative example of a Complex Subject claim in an SSF
   event.

   "sub_id": {
     "format": "complex",
     "user" : {
       "format": "email",
       "email": "bar@example.com"
     },
     "tenant" : {
       "format": "iss_sub",
       "iss" : "https://example.com/idp1",
       "sub" : "1234"
     }
   }

                     Figure 2: Example: Complex Subject

3.3.1.  Complex Subject Interpretation

   All members within a Complex Subject MUST represent attributes of the
   same Subject Principal.  As a whole, the Complex Subject MUST refer
   to exactly one Subject Principal.

3.4.  Subject Identifiers in SSF Events

   A Subject Identifier in an SSF event MUST have an identifier format
   that is any one of:

   *  Defined in the IANA Registry defined in Subject Identifiers for
      Security Event Tokens [RFC9493]

   *  An identifier format defined in the Additional Subject Identifier
      Formats (Section 3.5) section below, OR

   *  A proprietary subject identifier format that is agreed to between
      parties.  Members within a subject identifier that has a
      proprietary subject identifier format are agreed to between the
      parties and such agreement is outside the scope of this
      specification.

3.5.  Additional Subject Identifier Formats

   The following new subject identifier formats are defined:

3.5.1.  JWT ID Subject Identifier Format

   The "JWT ID" Subject Identifier Format specifies a JSON Web Token
   (JWT) identifier, defined in [RFC7519].  Subject Identifiers of this
   type MUST contain the following members:

   iss

      REQUIRED.  The "iss" (issuer) claim of the JWT being identified,
      defined in [RFC7519]

   jti

      REQUIRED.  The "jti" (JWT token ID) claim of the JWT being
      identified, defined in [RFC7519]

   The "JWT ID" Subject Identifier Format is identified by the name
   "jwt_id".

   Below is a non-normative example of Subject Identifier for the
   "jwt_id" Subject Identifier Format.

   {
       "format": "jwt_id",
       "iss": "https://idp.example.com/123456789/",
       "jti": "B70BA622-9515-4353-A866-823539EECBC8"
   }

               Figure 3: Example: 'jwt_id' Subject Identifier

3.5.2.  SAML Assertion ID Subject Identifier Format

   The "SAML Assertion ID" Subject Identifier Format specifies a SAML
   2.0 [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os] assertion identifier.  Subject
   Identifiers of this format MUST contain the following members:

   issuer

      REQUIRED.  The "Issuer" value of the SAML assertion being
      identified, defined in [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os]

   assertion_id

      REQUIRED.  The "ID" value of the SAML assertion being identified,
      defined in [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os]

   The "SAML Assertion ID" Subject Identifier Format is identified by
   the name "saml_assertion_id".

   Below is a non-normative example of Subject Identifier for the
   "saml_assertion_id" Subject Identifier Format.

   {
       "format": "saml_assertion_id",
       "issuer": "https://idp.example.com/123456789/",
       "assertion_id": "_8e8dc5f69a98cc4c1ff3427e5ce34606fd672f91e6"
   }

         Figure 4: Example: 'saml_assertion_id' Subject Identifier

3.6.  Receiver Subject Processing

   A SSF Receiver MUST make a best effort to process all members from a
   Subject in an SSF event.  The Transmitter Configuration Metadata
   (Section 6.1) defined below MAY define certain members within a
   Complex Subject to be Critical.  A SSF Receiver MUST discard any
   event that contains a Subject with a Critical member that it is
   unable to process.

4.  Event Properties

   Additional members about an event may be included in the "events"
   claim.  Some of these members are required and specified as such in
   the respective event types specs.  If a Transmitter determines that
   it needs to include additional members that are not specified in the
   event types spec, then the name of such members MUST be a URI.  The
   discoverability of all additional members is specified in the
   Discovery section (Section 6).

5.  Example SETs that conform to the Shared Signals Framework

   The following are hypothetical examples of SETs that conform to the
   Shared Signals Framework.

6.  Transmitter Configuration Discovery

   This section defines a mechanism for Receivers to obtain the
   Transmitter Configuration Metadata.

6.1.  Transmitter Configuration Metadata

   Transmitters have metadata describing their configuration:

   spec_version

      OPTIONAL.  A version identifying the implementer's draft or final
      specification implemented by the Transmitter.  This includes the
      numerical portion of the spec version as described in the document
      [NAMINGCONVENTION].  If absent, the Transmitter is assumed to
      conform to "1_0-ID1" version of the specification (this document).

      The following is a non-normative example of a Transmitter that
      implements the third implementer's draft of the Shared Signals
      Framework specification 1_0.

      {
           "spec_version": "1_0-ID3"
      }

     Figure 9: Example spec_version referring to the 2nd implementer's
                           draft of the 1_0 spec

      The following is a non-normative example of a Transmitter that
      implements the final specification of the Shared Signals Framework
      1_0.

      {
           "spec_version": "1_0"
      }

      Figure 10: Example: spec_version referring to the final 1_0 spec

   issuer

      REQUIRED.  URL using the https scheme with no query or fragment
      component that the Transmitter asserts as its Issuer Identifier.
      This MUST be identical to the iss claim value in Security Event
      Tokens issued from this Transmitter.

   jwks_uri

                              SharedSignals                    June 2024


      OPTIONAL.  URL of the Transmitter's JSON Web Key Set [RFC7517]
      document.  This contains the signing key(s) the Receiver uses to
      validate signatures from the Transmitter.  This value MUST be
      specified if the Transmitter intends to generate signed JWTs.  If
      present, this URL MUST use HTTP over TLS [RFC9110].

   delivery_methods_supported

      RECOMMENDED.  List of supported delivery method URIs.

   configuration_endpoint

      OPTIONAL.  The URL of the Configuration Endpoint.  If present,
      this URL MUST use HTTP over TLS [RFC9110].

   status_endpoint

      OPTIONAL.  The URL of the Status Endpoint.  If present, this URL
      MUST use HTTP over TLS [RFC9110].

   add_subject_endpoint

      OPTIONAL.  The URL of the Add Subject Endpoint.  If present, this
      URL MUST use HTTP over TLS [RFC9110].

   remove_subject_endpoint

      OPTIONAL.  The URL of the Remove Subject Endpoint.  If present,
      this URL MUST use HTTP over TLS [RFC9110].

   verification_endpoint

      OPTIONAL.  The URL of the Verification Endpoint.  If present, this
      URL MUST use HTTP over TLS [RFC9110].

   critical_subject_members

      OPTIONAL.  An array of member names in a Complex Subject which, if
      present in a Subject Member in an event, MUST be interpreted by a
      Receiver.

   authorization_schemes









Tulshibagwale, et al.        Standards Track                   [Page 12]

                              SharedSignals                    June 2024


      OPTIONAL.  An array of JSON objects that specify the supported
      authorization scheme properties defined in Section 6.1.1.  To
      enable seamless discovery of configurations, the service provider
      SHOULD, with the appropriate security considerations, make the
      authorization_schemes attribute publicly accessible without prior
      authentication.

   default_subjects

      OPTIONAL.  A string indicating the default behavior of newly
      created streams.  If present, the value MUST be either "ALL" or
      "NONE".  If not provided, the Transmitter behavior in this regard
      is unspecified.  - "ALL" indicates that any subjects that are
      appropriate for the stream are added to the stream by default.
      The Receiver MAY remove subjects from the stream via the
      remove_subject_endpoint, causing events for those subjects to
      _not_ be transmitted.  The Receiver MAY re-add any subjects
      removed this way via the add_subject_endpoint.  - "NONE" indicates
      that no subjects are added by default.  The Receiver MAY add
      subjects to the stream via the add_subject_endpoint, causing only
      events for those subjects to be transmitted.  The Receiver MAY
      remove subjects added this way via the remove_subject_endpoint.

   TODO: consider adding a IANA Registry for metadata, similar to
   Section 7.1.1 of [RFC8414].  This would allow other specs to add to
   the metadata.

6.1.1.  Authorization scheme

   SSF is an HTTP based signals sharing framework and is agnostic to the
   authentication and authorization schemes used to secure stream
   configuration APIs.  It does not provide any SSF-specific
   authentication and authorization schemes but relies on the
   cooperating parties' mutual security considerations.  The
   authorization scheme section of the metadata provides discovery
   information related to the Transmitter's stream management APIs.

   spec_urn

      REQUIRED.  A URN that describes the specification of the protocol
      being used.

   The Receiver will call the Transmitter APIs by providing appropriate
   credentials as per the spec_urn.

   The following is a non-normative example of the spec_urn





Tulshibagwale, et al.        Standards Track                   [Page 13]

                              SharedSignals                    June 2024


      {
           "spec_urn": "urn:ietf:rfc:6749"
      }

      Figure 11: Example: `spec_urn` specifying the OAuth protocol for
                               authorization

   In this case, the Receiver may obtain an access token using the
   Client Credentials Grant [CLIENTCRED], or any other method suitable
   for the Receiver and the Transmitter.

6.2.  Obtaining Transmitter Configuration Metadata

   Using the Issuer URL as documented by the Transmitter, the
   Transmitter Configuration Metadata can be retrieved.  Receivers
   SHOULD ensure that the Issuer URL comes from a trusted source and
   uses the https scheme.

   Transmitters supporting Discovery MUST make a JSON document available
   at the path formed by inserting the string "/.well-known/ssf-
   configuration" into the Issuer between the host component and the
   path component, if any.  The syntax and semantics of ".well-known"
   are defined in [RFC8615].  "ssf-configuration" MUST point to a JSON
   document compliant with this specification, and that document MUST be
   returned using the "application/json" content type.

6.2.1.  Transmitter Configuration Request

   A Transmitter Configuration Document MUST be queried using an HTTP
   "GET" request at the previously specified path.

   The Receiver would make the following request to the Issuer
   "https://tr.example.com" to obtain its Transmitter Configuration
   Metadata, since the Issuer contains no path component:

   GET /.well-known/ssf-configuration HTTP/1.1
   Host: tr.example.com

    Figure 12: Example: Transmitter Configuration Request (without path)

   If the Issuer value contains a path component, any terminating "/"
   MUST be removed before inserting "/.well-known/ssf-configuration"
   between the host component and the path component.  The Receiver
   would make the following request to the Issuer
   "https://tr.example.com/issuer1" to obtain its Transmitter
   Configuration Metadata, since the Issuer contains a path component:





Tulshibagwale, et al.        Standards Track                   [Page 14]

                              SharedSignals                    June 2024


   GET /.well-known/ssf-configuration/issuer1 HTTP/1.1
   Host: tr.example.com

     Figure 13: Example: Transmitter Configuration Request (with path)

   Using path components enables supporting multiple issuers per host.
   This is required in some multi-tenant hosting configurations.  This
   use of ".well-known" is for supporting multiple issuers per host;
   unlike its use in [RFC8615], it does not provide general information
   about the host.

6.2.2.  Backward Compatibility for RISC Transmitters

   Existing RISC Transmitters MAY continue to use the path component
   "/risc-configuration" instead of the path component "/ssf-
   configuration" in the path for the Transmitter Configuration
   Metadata.  New services supporting the Shared Signals Framework
   SHOULD NOT use this location for publishing the Transmitter
   Configuration Metadata.  For example, the Transmitter Configuration
   Metadata for the Transmitter "https://risc-tr.example.com" MAY be
   obtained by making the following request:

   GET /.well-known/risc-configuration HTTP/1.1
   Host: risc-tr.example.com

       Figure 14: Example: Transmitter Configuration Request for RISC
                                Transmitters

6.2.3.  Transmitter Configuration Response

   The response is a set of Claims about the Transmitter's
   configuration, including all necessary endpoints and public key
   location information.  A successful response MUST use the 200 OK HTTP
   status code and return a JSON object using the "application/json"
   content type that contains a set of Claims as its members that are a
   subset of the Metadata values defined in Section 6.1.  Other Claims
   MAY also be returned.

   Claims that return multiple values are represented as JSON arrays.
   Claims with zero elements MUST be omitted from the response.

   An error response uses the applicable HTTP status code value.

   The following is a non-normative example of a Transmitter
   Configuration Response

6.2.4.  Transmitter Configuration Validation

   If any of the validation procedures defined in this specification
   fail, any operations requiring the information that failed to
   correctly validate MUST be aborted and the information that failed to
   validate MUST NOT be used.

   The "issuer" value returned MUST be identical to the Issuer URL that
   was directly used to retrieve the configuration information.  This
   MUST also be identical to the "iss" Claim value in Security Event
   Tokens issued from this Transmitter.

7.  Management API for SET Event Streams

   An Event Stream is an abstraction for how events are communicated
   from a Transmitter to a Receiver.  The Event Stream's configuration,
   which is jointly managed by the Transmitter and Receiver, holds
   information about what types of events will be sent from the
   Transmitter, as well as the mechanism by which the Receiver can
   expect to receive the events.  The Event Stream also keeps track of
   what Subjects are of interest to the Receiver, and only events with
   those Subjects are transmitted on the stream.

   This section defines an HTTP API to be implemented by Event
   Transmitters which can be used by Event Receivers to create and
   delete one or more Event Streams.  The API can also be used to query
   and update the Event Stream's configuration and status, add and
   remove Subjects, and trigger verification for those streams.

   Unless there exists some other method of establishing trust between a
   Transmitter and Receiver, all Stream Management API endpoints MUST
   use standard HTTP authentication and authorization schemes, as per
   [RFC9110].  This authorization MUST associate a Receiver with one or
   more stream IDs and "aud" values, such that only authorized Receivers
   are able to access or modify the details of the associated Event
   Streams.

   It is OPTIONAL for Transmitters to implement a Management API, but it
   is RECOMMENDED that they implement it, especially the endpoints for
   querying the Stream Status and for triggering Verification.

7.1.  Event Stream Management

   Event Receivers manage how they receive events and the subjects about
   which they want to receive events over an Event Stream by making HTTP
   requests to endpoints in the Event Stream Management API.

   A Transmitter and Receiver MAY use the same Event Stream for updates
   about multiple Subject Principals.  The status of the Event Stream
   MAY be queried and managed independently for each Subject Principal
   by Transmitters and Receivers.

   The Event Stream Management API is implemented by the Event
   Transmitter and consists of the following endpoints:

   Configuration Endpoint

      An endpoint used to create and delete Event Streams, as well as
      read and update an Event Stream's current configuration.

   Status Endpoint

      An endpoint used to read and update an Event Stream's current
      status.

   Add Subject Endpoint

      An endpoint used to add subjects to an Event Stream.

   Remove Subject Endpoint

      An endpoint used to remove subjects from an Event Stream.

   Verification Endpoint

      An endpoint used to request the Event Transmitter to transmit a
      Verification Event over an Event Stream.

   An Event Transmitter MAY use the same URLs as endpoints for multiple
   Event Receivers, provided that the Event Transmitter has some
   mechanism through which they can identify the applicable set of Event
   Streams for any given request, e.g. from authentication credentials.
   The definition of such mechanisms is outside the scope of this
   specification.

7.1.1.  Stream Configuration

   An Event Stream's configuration is a collection of data, provided by
   both the Transmitter and the Receiver, that describes the information
   being sent over the Event Stream.  It is represented as a JSON
   [RFC7159] object with the following properties:

   stream_id

      *Transmitter-Supplied*, REQUIRED.  A string that uniquely
      identifies the stream.  A Transmitter MUST generate a unique ID
      for each of its non-deleted streams at the time of stream
      creation.

   iss

      *Transmitter-Supplied*, REQUIRED.  A URL using the https scheme
      with no query or fragment component that the Transmitter asserts
      as its Issuer Identifier.  This MUST be identical to the "iss"
      Claim value in Security Event Tokens issued from this Transmitter.

   aud

      *Transmitter-Supplied*, REQUIRED.  A string or an array of strings
      containing an audience claim as defined in JSON Web Token
      (JWT)[RFC7519] that identifies the Event Receiver(s) for the Event
      Stream.  This property cannot be updated.  If multiple Receivers
      are specified then the Transmitter SHOULD know that these
      Receivers are the same entity.

   events_supported

      *Transmitter-Supplied*, OPTIONAL.  An array of URIs identifying
      the set of events supported by the Transmitter for this Receiver.
      If omitted, Event Transmitters SHOULD make this set available to
      the Event Receiver via some other means (e.g. publishing it in
      online documentation).

   events_requested

      *Receiver-Supplied*, OPTIONAL.  An array of URIs identifying the
      set of events that the Receiver requested.  A Receiver SHOULD
      request only the events that it understands and it can act on.
      This is configurable by the Receiver.  A Transmitter MUST ignore
      any array values that it does not understand.  This array SHOULD
      NOT be empty.

   events_delivered

                              SharedSignals                    June 2024


      *Transmitter-Supplied*, REQUIRED.  An array of URIs identifying
      the set of events that the Transmitter MUST include in the stream.
      This is a subset (not necessarily a proper subset) of the
      intersection of "events_supported" and "events_requested".  A
      Receiver MUST rely on the values received in this field to
      understand which event types it can expect from the Transmitter.

   delivery

      REQUIRED.  A JSON object containing a set of name/value pairs
      specifying configuration parameters for the SET delivery method.
      The actual delivery method is identified by the special key
      "method" with the value being a URI as defined in Section 10.3.1.
      The value of the "delivery" field contains two sub-fields:

      method

      *Receiver-Supplied*, REQUIRED.  The specific delivery method to
         be used.  This can be any one of "urn:ietf:rfc:8935" (push) or
         "urn:ietf:rfc:8936" (poll), but not both.

      endpoint_url

      REQUIRED.  The location at which the push or poll delivery will
         take place.  If the method value is "urn:ietf:rfc:8935" (push),
         then this value MUST be supplied by the Receiver.  If the
         method value is "urn:ietf:rfc:8936" (poll), then this value
         MUST be supplied by the Transmitter.

   min_verification_interval

      *Transmitter-Supplied*, OPTIONAL.  An integer indicating the
      minimum amount of time in seconds that must pass in between
      verification requests.  If an Event Receiver submits verification
      requests more frequently than this, the Event Transmitter MAY
      respond with a 429 status code.  An Event Transmitter SHOULD NOT
      respond with a 429 status code if an Event Receiver is not
      exceeding this frequency.

   description

      *Receiver-Supplied*, OPTIONAL.  A string that describes the
      properties of the stream.  This is useful in multi-stream systems
      to identify the stream for human actors.  The transmitter MAY
      truncate the string beyond an allowed max length.

   TODO: consider adding a IANA Registry for stream configuration
   metadata, similar to Section 7.1.1 of [RFC8414].  This would allow
   other specs to add to the stream configuration.

7.1.1.1.  Creating a Stream

   In order to communicate events from a Transmitter to a Receiver, a
   Receiver MUST first create an Event Stream.  An Event Receiver
   creates a stream by making an HTTP POST request to the Configuration
   Endpoint.  On receiving a valid request the Event Transmitter
   responds with a "201 Created" response containing a JSON [RFC7159]
   representation of the stream's configuration in the body.  The
   Receiver MUST check the response and confirm that the iss value
   matches the Issuer from which it received the Transmitter
   Configuration data.

   If a stream already exists, and the Transmitter allows multiple
   streams with the same Receiver, the Event Transmitter MUST respond
   with a new stream ID.  If the Transmitter does not allow multiple
   streams with the same Receiver, it MUST respond respond with HTTP
   status code "409 Conflict".  The Receiver MAY then GET the existing
   stream configuration and, if desired, use PATCH or PUT to update or
   replace the existing stream configuration.

   The HTTP POST request MAY contain the Receiver-Supplied values of the
   Stream Configuration (Section 7.1.1) object:

   *  events_requested

   *  delivery : Note that in the case of the poll method, the
      endpoint_url value is supplied by the Transmitter.

   If the request does not contain the delivery property, then the
   Transmitter MUST assume that the method is "urn:ietf:rfc:8936"
   (poll).  The Transmitter MUST include a delivery property in the
   response with this method property and an endpoint_url property.

   The following is a non-normative example request to create an Event
   Stream:

7.1.1.2.  Reading a Stream's Configuration

   An Event Receiver gets the current configuration of a stream by
   making an HTTP GET request to the Configuration Endpoint.  On
   receiving a valid request, the Event Transmitter responds with a "200
   OK" response containing a JSON [RFC7159] representation of the
   stream's configuration in the body.  The Receiver MUST check the
   response and confirm that the iss value matches the Issuer from which
   it received the Transmitter Configuration data.

   The GET request MAY include the "stream_id" as a query parameter in
   order to identify the correct Event Stream.  If the "stream_id"
   parameter is missing, then the Transmitter MUST return a list of the
   stream configurations available to this Receiver.  In the event that
   there are no Event Streams configured, the Transmitter MUST return an
   empty list.

   The following is a non-normative example request to read an Event
   Stream's configuration:

7.1.1.3.  Updating a Stream's Configuration

   An Event Receiver updates the current configuration of a stream by
   making an HTTP PATCH request to the Configuration Endpoint.  The
   PATCH body contains a JSON [RFC7159] representation of the stream
   configuration properties to change.  On receiving a valid request,
   the Event Transmitter responds with a "200 OK" response containing a
   JSON [RFC7159] representation of the entire updated stream
   configuration in the body.  The Receiver MUST check the response and
   confirm that the iss value matches the Issuer from which it received
   the Transmitter Configuration data.

   The stream_id property MUST be present in the request.  Other
   properties MAY be present in the request.  Any Receiver-Supplied
   property present in the request MUST be updated by the Transmitter.
   Any properties missing in the request MUST NOT be changed by the
   Transmitter.  If events_requested property is included in the
   request, it SHOULD NOT be an empty array.

   Transmitter-Supplied properties besides the stream_id MAY be present,
   but they MUST match the expected value.  Missing Transmitter-Supplied
   properties MUST be ignored by the Transmitter.  The events_delivered
   property, if present, MUST match the Transmitter's expected value
   before any updates are applied.

7.1.1.4.  Replacing a Stream's Configuration

   An Event Receiver replaces the current configuration of a stream by
   making an HTTP PUT request to the Configuration Endpoint.  The PUT
   body contains a JSON [RFC7159] representation of the new
   configuration.  On receiving a valid request, the Event Transmitter
   responds with a "200 OK" response containing a JSON [RFC7159]
   representation of the updated stream configuration in the body.  The
   Receiver MUST check the response and confirm that the iss value
   matches the Issuer from which it received the Transmitter
   Configuration data.

   The stream_id and the full set of Receiver-Supplied properties MUST
   be present in the PUT body, not only those specifically intended to
   be changed.  Missing Receiver-Supplied properties MUST be interpreted
   as requested to be deleted.  Event Receivers MAY read the
   configuration first, modify the JSON [RFC7159] representation, then
   make a replacement request.  If events_requested property is included
   in the request, it SHOULD NOT be an empty array.

   Transmitter-Supplied properties besides the stream_id MAY be present,
   but they MUST match the expected value.  Missing Transmitter-Supplied
   properties MUST be ignored by the Transmitter.  The events_delivered
   property, if present, MUST match the Transmitter's expected value
   _before_ any updates are applied.

7.1.1.5.  Deleting a Stream

   An Event Receiver deletes a stream by making an HTTP DELETE request
   to the Configuration Endpoint.  On receiving a request, the Event
   Transmitter responds with an empty "204 No Content" response if the
   configuration was successfully removed.

   The DELETE request MUST include the "stream_id" as a query parameter
   in order to identify the correct Event Stream.

7.1.2.  Stream Status

   Event Streams are managed independently.  A Receiver MAY request that
   events from a stream be interrupted by Updating the Stream Status
   (Section 7.1.2.2).  If a Transmitter decides to enable, pause or
   disable updates from a stream independently of an update request from
   a Receiver, it MUST send a Stream Updated Event (Section 7.1.5) to
   the Receiver.

7.1.2.1.  Reading a Stream's Status

   An Event Receiver checks the current status of an Event Stream by
   making an HTTP GET request to the stream's Status Endpoint.

   The Stream Status method takes the following parameters:

   stream_id

      REQUIRED.  A string identifying the stream whose status is being
      queried.

   On receiving a valid request, the Event Transmitter responds with a
   200 OK response containing a JSON [RFC7159] object with the following
   attributes:

   stream_id

      REQUIRED.  A string identifying the stream whose status is being
      queried.

   status

                              SharedSignals                    June 2024


      REQUIRED.  A string whose value MUST be one of the values
      described below.

   reason

      An OPTIONAL string whose value SHOULD express why the stream's
      status is set to the current value.

   The allowable "status" values are:

   enabled

      The Transmitter MUST transmit events over the stream, according to
      the stream's configured delivery method.

   paused

      The Transmitter MUST NOT transmit events over the stream.  The
      Transmitter will hold any events it would have transmitted while
      paused, and SHOULD transmit them when the stream's status becomes
      "enabled".  If a Transmitter holds successive events that affect
      the same Subject Principal, then the Transmitter MUST make sure
      that those events are transmitted in the order of time that they
      were generated OR the Transmitter MUST send only the last events
      that do not require the previous events affecting the same Subject
      Principal to be processed by the Receiver, because the previous
      events are either cancelled by the later events or the previous
      events are outdated.

   disabled

      The Transmitter MUST NOT transmit events over the stream and will
      not hold any events for later transmission.

   The following is a non-normative example request to check an Event
   Stream's status:

   GET /ssf/status?stream_id=f67e39a0a4d34d56b3aa1bc4cff0069f HTTP/1.1

   Examples:

   1.  If a Receiver makes an unauthorized request, then the Transmitter
       MUST respond with a 401 error status.

   2.  If a Receiver makes an authorized request, but the Transmitter
       policy does not permit the Receiver from obtaining the status,
       then the Transmitter MAY respond with a 403 error status.

   3.  If the Receiver requests the status for a stream that does not
       exist then the Transmitter MUST respond with a 404 error status.

7.1.2.2.  Updating a Stream's Status

   An Event Receiver updates the current status of a stream by making an
   HTTP POST request to the Status Endpoint.  The POST body contains a
   JSON [RFC7159] object with the following fields:

   stream_id

      REQUIRED.  A string identifying the stream whose status is being
      updated.

   status

      REQUIRED.  The new status of the Event Stream.

   reason

      OPTIONAL.  A short text description that explains the reason for
      the change.

   On receiving a valid request, the Event Transmitter responds with a
   "200 OK" response containing a JSON [RFC7159] representation of the
   updated stream status in the body, using the same fields as described
   in the request.

   The following is a non-normative example request to update an Event
   Stream's status:

   Examples:

       Transmitter is unable to decide whether or not to complete the
       request, then the Transmitter MUST respond with a 202 status
       code.

7.1.3.  Subjects

   An Event Receiver can indicate to an Event Transmitter whether or not
   the Receiver wants to receive events about a particular subject by
   "adding" or "removing" that subject to the Event Stream,
   respectively.

   If a Receiver adds a subject to a stream, the Transmitter SHOULD send
   any events relating to the subject, which have event_types that the
   Receiver has subscribed to, and both the stream and the subject are
   enabled.  In the case of Simple Subjects, two subjects match if they
   are exactly identical.  For Complex Subjects, two subjects match if,
   for all fields in the Complex Subject (i.e. user, group, device,
   etc.), at least one of the following statements is true:

   1.  Subject 1's field is not defined

   2.  Subject 2's field is not defined

   3.  Subject 1's field is identical to Subject 2's field

7.1.3.1.  Adding a Subject to a Stream

   To add a subject to an Event Stream, the Event Receiver makes an HTTP
   POST request to the Add Subject Endpoint, containing in the body a
   JSON object the following claims:

   stream_id

      REQUIRED.  A string identifying the stream to which the subject is
      being added.

   subject

      REQUIRED.  A Subject claim identifying the subject to be added.

   verified

      OPTIONAL.  A boolean value; when true, it indicates that the Event
      Receiver has verified the Subject claim.  When false, it indicates
      that the Event Receiver has not verified the Subject claim.  If
      omitted, Event Transmitters SHOULD assume that the subject has
      been verified.

   On a successful response, the Event Transmitter responds with an
   empty "200 OK" response.  The Event Transmitter MAY choose to
   silently ignore the request, for example if the subject has
   previously indicated to the Transmitter that they do not want events
   to be transmitted to the Event Receiver.  In this case, the
   Transmitter MAY return an empty "200 OK" response or an appropriate
   error code.  See Security Considerations (Section 8).

   The following is a non-normative example request to add a subject to
   a stream, where the subject is identified by an Email Subject
   Identifier.

   stream_id

      REQUIRED.  A string identifying the stream from which the subject
      is being removed.

7.1.4.  Verification

   In some cases, the frequency of event transmission on an Event Stream
   will be very low, making it difficult for an Event Receiver to tell
   the difference between expected behavior and event transmission
   failure due to a misconfigured stream.  Event Receivers can request
   that a Verification Event be transmitted over the Event Stream,
   allowing the Receiver to confirm that the stream is configured
   correctly upon successful receipt of the event.  The acknowledgment
   of a Verification Event also confirms to the Event Transmitter that
   end-to-end delivery is working, including signature verification and
   encryption.

   A Transmitter MAY send a Verification Event at any time, even if one
   was not requested by the Event Receiver.

   A Transmitter MAY respond to Verification Event requests even if the
   event is not present in the events_supported, events_requested and /
   or events_delivered fields in the Stream Configuration
   (Section 7.1.1).

7.1.4.1.  Verification Event

   The Verification Event is an SSF event with the event type:
   "https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/ssf/event-type/verification".
   The event contains the following attribute:

   state

      OPTIONAL An opaque value provided by the Event Receiver when the
      event is triggered.

   As with any SSF event, the Verification Event has a top-level sub_id
   claim:

   sub_id

      REQUIRED.  The value of the top-level sub_id claim in a
      Verification Event MUST always be set to have a simple value of
      type opaque.  The id of the value MUST be the stream_id of the
      stream being verified.

      Note that the subject that identifies a stream itself is always
      implicitly added to the stream and MAY NOT be removed from the
      stream.






Tulshibagwale, et al.        Standards Track                   [Page 45]

                              SharedSignals                    June 2024


   Upon receiving a Verification Event, the Event Receiver SHALL parse
   the SET and validate its claims.  In particular, the Event Receiver
   SHALL confirm that the value for "state" is as expected.  If the
   value of "state" does not match, an error response with the "err"
   field set to "invalid_state" SHOULD be returned (see Section 2.4 of
   [RFC8935] or Section 2.4.4 of [RFC8936]).

   In many cases, Event Transmitters MAY disable or suspend an Event
   Stream that fails to successfully verify based on the acknowledgement
   or lack of acknowledgement by the Event Receiver.

7.1.4.2.  Triggering a Verification Event.

   To request that a Verification Event be sent over an Event Stream,
   the Event Receiver makes an HTTP POST request to the Verification
   Endpoint, with a JSON [RFC7159] object containing the parameters of
   the verification request, if any.  On a successful request, the Event
   Transmitter responds with an empty "204 No Content" response.

   Verification requests have the following properties:

   stream_id

      REQUIRED.  A string identifying the stream that the Verification
      Event is being requested on.

   state

      OPTIONAL.  An arbitrary string that the Event Transmitter MUST
      echo back to the Event Receiver in the Verification Event's
      payload.  Event Receivers MAY use the value of this parameter to
      correlate a Verification Event with a verification request.  If
      the Verification Event is initiated by the Transmitter then this
      parameter MUST not be set.

   A successful response from a POST to the Verification Endpoint does
   not indicate that the Verification Event was transmitted
   successfully, only that the Event Transmitter has transmitted the
   event or will do so at some point in the future.  Event Transmitters
   MAY transmit the event via an asynchronous process, and SHOULD
   publish an SLA for Verification Event transmission times.  Event
   Receivers MUST NOT depend on the Verification Event being transmitted
   synchronously or in any particular order relative to the current
   queue of events.

   Errors are signaled with HTTP status codes as follows:

7.1.5.  Stream Updated Event

   A Transmitter MAY change the stream status without a request from a
   Receiver.  The Transmitter sends an event of type
   "https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/ssf/event-type/stream-updated"
   to indicate that it has changed the status of the Event Stream.

   If a Transmitter decides to change the status of an Event Stream from
   "enabled" to either "paused" or "disabled", then the Transmitter MUST
   send this event to the Receiver before stopping the stream.

   If the Transmitter changes the status of the stream from either
   "paused" or "disabled" to "enabled", then it MUST send this event to
   the Receiver upon re-enabling the stream.

   A Transmitter MAY send a Stream Updated event even if the event is
   not present in the events_supported, events_requested and / or
   events_delivered fields in the Stream Configuration (Section 7.1.1).

   The "stream-updated" event contains the following claims:

   status

      REQUIRED.  Defines the new status of the stream.

   reason

      OPTIONAL.  Provides a short description of why the Transmitter has
      updated the status.

                              SharedSignals                    June 2024


   As with any SSF event, this event has a top-level sub_id claim:

   sub_id

      REQUIRED.  The top-level sub_id claim specifies the Stream Id for
      which the status has been updated.  The value of the sub_id field
      MUST be of format opaque, and its id value MUST be the unique ID
      of the stream.

      Note that the subject that identifies a stream itself is always
      implicitly added to the stream and MAY NOT be removed from the
      stream.

      Below is a non-normative example of a Stream Updated event.

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  Subject Probing

   It may be possible for an Event Transmitter to leak information about
   subjects through their responses to add subject requests.  A "404"
   response may indicate to the Event Receiver that the subject does not
   exist, which may inadvertently reveal information about the subject
   (e.g. that a particular individual does or does not use the Event
   Transmitter service).

   Event Transmitters SHOULD carefully evaluate the conditions under
   which they will return error responses to add subject requests.
   Event Transmitters MAY return a "204" response even if they will not



Tulshibagwale, et al.        Standards Track                   [Page 49]

                              SharedSignals                    June 2024


   actually send any events related to the subject, and Event Receivers
   MUST NOT assume that a 204 response means that they will receive
   events related to the subject.

8.2.  Information Harvesting

   SETs may contain personally identifiable information (PII) or other
   non-public information about the Event Transmitter, the subject (of
   an event in the SET), or the relationship between the two.  It is
   important for Event Transmitters to understand what information they
   are revealing to Event Receivers when transmitting events to them,
   lest the Event Stream become a vector for unauthorized access to
   private information.

   Event Transmitters SHOULD interpret add subject requests as
   statements of interest in a subject by an Event Receiver, and ARE NOT
   obligated to transmit events related to every subject an Event
   Receiver adds to the stream.  Event Transmitters MAY choose to
   transmit some, all, or no events related to any given subject and
   SHOULD validate that they are permitted to share the information
   contained within an event with the Event Receiver before transmitting
   the event.  The mechanisms by which such validation is performed are
   outside the scope of this specification.

8.3.  Malicious Subject Removal

   A malicious party may find it advantageous to remove a particular
   subject from a stream, in order to reduce the Event Receiver's
   ability to detect malicious activity related to the subject,
   inconvenience the subject, or for other reasons.  Consequently it may
   be in the best interests of the subject for the Event Transmitter to
   continue to send events related to the subject for some time after
   the subject has been removed from a stream.

   Event Transmitters MAY continue sending events related to a subject
   for some amount of time after that subject has been removed from the
   stream.  Event Receivers MUST tolerate receiving events for subjects
   that have been removed from the stream, and MUST NOT report these
   events as errors to the Event Transmitter.

9.  Privacy Considerations

                              SharedSignals                    June 2024


9.1.  Subject Information Leakage

   Event Transmitters and Receivers SHOULD take precautions to ensure
   that they do not leak information about subjects via Subject
   Identifiers, and choose appropriate Subject Identifier Types
   accordingly.  Parties SHOULD NOT identify a subject using a given
   Subject Identifier Type if doing so will allow the recipient to
   correlate different claims about the subject that they are not known
   to already have knowledge of.  Transmitters and Receivers SHOULD
   always use the same Subject Identifier Type and the same claim values
   to identify a given subject when communicating with a given party in
   order to reduce the possibility of information leakage.

9.2.  Previously Consented Data

   If SSF events contain new values for attributes of Subject Principals
   that were previously exchanged between the Transmitter and Receiver,
   then there are no additional privacy considerations introduced by
   providing the updated values in the SSF events, unless the attribute
   was exchanged under a one-time consent obtained from the user.

9.3.  New Data

   Data that was not previously exchanged between the Transmitter and
   the Receiver, or data whose consent to exchange has expired has the
   following considerations:

9.3.1.  Organizational Data

   If a user has previously agreed with a Transmitter that they allow
   the release of certain data to third-parties, then the Transmitter
   MAY send such data in SSF events without additional consent of the
   user.  Such data MAY include organizational data about the Subject
   Principal that was generated by the Transmitter.

9.3.2.  Consentable Data

   If a Transmitter intends to include data in SSF events that is not
   previously consented to be released by the user, then the Transmitter
   MUST obtain consent to release such data from the user in accordance
   with the Transmitter's privacy policy.

10.  Profiles

   This section is a profile of the following IETF Security Event
   specifications:

   *  Security Event Token (SET) [RFC8417]

   *  Push-Based SET Token Delivery Using HTTP [RFC8935]

   *  Poll-Based SET Token Delivery Using HTTP [RFC8936]

   The RISC use cases that set the requirements are described in
   Security Events RISC Use Cases [USECASES].

   The CAEP use cases that set the requirements are described in CAEP
   Use Cases (TODO: Add reference when file is added to repository.)

10.1.  Security Event Token Profile

   This section provides SSF profiling specifications for the Security
   Event Token (SET) [RFC8417] spec.

10.1.1.  Signature Key Resolution

   The signature key can be obtained through "jwks_uri", see Section 6.

10.1.2.  SSF Event Subject

   The primary Subject Member of SSF events is described in the "Subject
   Members" section (Section 3).  The JWT "sub" claim MUST NOT be
   present in any SET containing an SSF event.

10.1.3.  SSF Event Properties

   The SSF event MAY contain additional claims within the event payload
   that are specific to the event type.

   }

10.1.4.  Explicit Typing of SETs

   SSF events MUST use explicit typing as defined in Section 2.3 of
   [RFC8417].

   {
     "typ":"secevent+jwt",
     "alg":"HS256"
   }

                  Figure 46: Explicitly Typed JOSE Header

   The purpose is defense against confusion with other JWTs, as
   described in Sections 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7 of [RFC8417].  While current
   Id Token [OpenID.Core] validators may not be using the "typ" header
   parameter, requiring it for SSF SETs guarantees a distinct value for
   future validators.

                              SharedSignals                    June 2024


10.2.  The "iss" Claim

   The "iss" claim MUST match the "iss" value in the Stream
   Configuration data for the stream that the event is sent on.
   Receivers MUST validate that this claim matches the "iss" in the
   Stream Configuration data, as well as the Issuer from which the
   Receiver requested the Transmitter Configuration data.

10.2.1.  The "exp" Claim

   The "exp" claim MUST NOT be used in SSF SETs.

   The purpose is defense in depth against confusion with other JWTs, as
   described in Sections 4.5 and 4.6 of [RFC8417].

10.2.2.  The "aud" Claim

   The "aud" claim can be a single string or an array of strings.
   Values that uniquely identify the Receiver to the Transmitter MAY be
   used, if the two parties have agreement on the format.

   More than one value can be present if the corresponding Receivers are
   known to the Transmitter to be the same entity, for example a web
   client and a mobile client of the same application.  All the
   Receivers in this case MUST use the exact same delivery method.

   If multiple Receivers have the exact same delivery configuration but
   the Transmitter does not know if they belong to the same entity then
   the Transmitter SHOULD issue distinct SETs for each Receiver and
   deliver them separately.  In this case the multiple Receivers might
   use the same service to process SETs, and this service might reroute
   SETs to respective Receivers, an "aud" claim with multiple Receivers
   would lead to unintended data disclosure.

     }
   }

               Figure 47: Example: SET with array 'aud' claim

10.2.3.  The "txn" claim

   Transmitters SHOULD set the "txn" claim value in Security Event
   Tokens (SETs).  If the value is present, it MUST be unique to the
   underlying event that caused the Transmitter to generate the Security
   Event Token (SET).  The Transmitter, however, may use the same value
   in the "txn" claim across different Security Events Tokens (SETs),
   such as session revoked and credential change, to indicate that the
   SETs originated from the same underlying cause or reason.

10.2.4.  The "events" claim

   The "events" claim SHOULD contain only one event.  Multiple event
   type URIs are permitted only if they are alternative URIs defining
   the exact same event type.

10.2.5.  Security Considerations

10.2.5.1.  Distinguishing SETs from other Kinds of JWTs

   Of particular concern is the possibility that SETs are confused for
   other kinds of JWTs.  The Security Considerations section of
   [RFC8417] has several sub-sections on this subject.  The Shared
   Signals Framework requires further restrictions:

   *  The "sub" claim MUST NOT be present, as described in
      Section 10.1.2.

   *  SSF SETs MUST use explicit typing, as described in Section 10.1.4.

   method

      "urn:ietf:rfc:8935"

   endpoint_url

      The URL where events are pushed through HTTP POST.  This is set by
      the Receiver.  If a Receiver is using multiple streams from a
      single Transmitter and needs to keep the SETs separated, it is
      RECOMMENDED that the URL for each stream be unique.

   authorization_header

      The HTTP Authorization header that the Transmitter MUST set with
      each event delivery, if the configuration is present.  The value
      is optional and it is set by the Receiver.

10.3.1.2.  Polling Delivery using HTTP

      The URL where events can be retrieved from.  This is specified by
      the Transmitter.  These URLs MAY be reused across Receivers, but
      MUST be unique per stream for a given Receiver.

11.  IANA Considerations

   Subject Identifiers defined in this document will be added to the
   "Security Events Subject Identifier Types" registry.  This registry
   is defined in the Subject Identifiers for Security Event Tokens
   [RFC9493] specification.

   The ssf-configuration well-known endpoint is registered in IANA's
   Well-Known URIs registry, as defined by [RFC8615].

   IANA is asked to assign the error code "invalid_state", as defined in
   Section 7.1.4.1, to the Security Event Token Error Codes section of
   the Security Event Token registry, as defined in Section 7.1 of
   [RFC8935].  The following information is provided as required by the
   registration template:

   Error Code

      invalid_state

   Description

      Indicates that a Verification event contained a "state" claim that
      does not match the value expected by the Receiver.
