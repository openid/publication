    </note>
    <note title="Introduction">
      <t>The Financial-grade API Standard provides a profile for OAuth 2.0 suitable for use in financial services. The standard OAuth method for the client to send the resource owner to the authorization server is to use an HTTP redirect. Parts 1 and 2 of this specification support this interaction model and are suitable for use cases where the resource owner is interacting with the client on a device they control that has a web browser. There are however many use-cases for initiating payments where the resource owner is not interacting with the client in such a manner. For example, the resource owner may want to authorize a payment at a "point of sale" terminal at a shop or fuel station.</t>
      <t>This document is a profile of the OpenID Connect Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow [CIBA] that supports this decoupled interaction method. The CIBA spec allows a client that gains knowledge of an identifier for the user to obtain tokens from the authorization server. The user consent is given at the user's Authentication Device mediated by the authorization server. This document profiles the CIBA specification to bring it in line with the other FAPI parts and provides security recommendations for its use with APIs that require financial-grade security.</t>
      <t>Although it is possible to code an OpenID Provider and Relying Party from first principles using this specification, the main audience for this specification is parties who already have a certified implementation of OpenID Connect and want to achieve a higher level of security. Implementors are encouraged to understand the security considerations contained in section 7.5 before embarking on a 'from scratch' implementation.</t>

These APIs are protected by the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework that consists of [RFC6749], [RFC6750], [RFC7636], and other specifications.  </t><t>The Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow [CIBA] specifies an alternate method of users granting access to their resources whereby the flow is started from a consumption device, but authorized on an authentication device.  </t><t>The following sections specify a profile of CIBA that is suited for financial-grade APIs.  </t></section><section title="Read and Write API Security Provisions" anchor="read-and-write-api-security-provisions" toc="default"><section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction-1" toc="default"><t>This profile applies to both Read-Only APIs and Read-and-Write APIs.  </t><t>This spec should be read in conjunction with OpenID Connect Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication Core [CIBA] and with parts 1 [FAPI1] and 2 [FAPI2] of the Financial-grade API specification.  </t></section><section title="Authorization Server" anchor="authorization-server" toc="default"><t>The Authorization Server shall support the provisions specified in clause 5.2.2 of Financial-grade API - Part 1 and clause 5.2.2 of Financial-grade API - Part 2.  </t><t>In addition the Authorization server, for all operations, </t><t><list style="numbers"><t>shall only support Confidential Clients for Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication flows; </t><t>shall ensure unique authorization context exists in the authorization request or require a binding_message in the authentication request; </t><t>shall not support CIBA push mode; </t><t>shall support CIBA poll mode; </t><t>may support CIBA ping mode; </t><t>shall require Backchannel Authentication Endpoint requests to be signed as described in [CIBA] 7.1.1; </t><t>shall require user authentication to an appropriate level for the operations the client will be authorized to perform on behalf of the user; </t><t>shall, if it supports the acr claim and the client has requested acr, return an 'acr' claim in the resulting ID token; </t><t>shall require the Signed Authentication Request to contain <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">nbf</spanx> and <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">exp</spanx> claims that limit the lifetime of the request to no more than 60 minutes; </t><t>may require clients to provide a <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">request_context</spanx> claim as defined in section 5.3 of this profile; and </t><t>should not use the login_hint or login_hint_token to convey "intent ids" or any other authorization metadata </t></list></t><t><spanx style="strong" xml:space="preserve">NOTE:</spanx> As per [CIBA], <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">login_hint</spanx>, <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">login_hint_token</spanx> and <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">id_token_hint</spanx> are used only to determine who the user is. In scenarios where complex authorization parameters need to be conveyed from the Client to the AS, implementers should consider the "lodging intent" pattern described in [FAPILI]. The use of parameterized scope values or the use of an additional request parameter are both supported by this specification. Examples of both patterns are shown in [FAPILI].  </t><t><spanx style="strong" xml:space="preserve">NOTE:</spanx> The binding message is required to protect the user by binding the session on the consumption device with the session on the authentication device. An example use case is when a user is paying at POS terminal. The user will enter their user identifier to start the [CIBA] flow, the terminal will then display a code, the user will receive a notification on their phone (the authentication device) to ask them to authenticate and authorize the transaction, as part of the authorization process the user will be shown a code and will be asked to check that it is the same as the one shown on the terminal.  </t><t><spanx style="strong" xml:space="preserve">NOTE:</spanx> The FAPI CIBA profile only supports CIBA ping and poll modes, therefore it is only possible to retrieve access tokens and optionally refresh tokens from the token endpoint. The same security requirements for the token endpoint as detailed in [FAPI1] and [FAPI2] apply.  </t><t><spanx style="strong" xml:space="preserve">NOTE:</spanx> Given that the CIBA flow places an added level of trust on the Client, the FAPI CIBA profile requires the use of Signed Authentication Requests. This will enable the Authorization Server to store such requests, in an easily verifiable form, for future auditing purposes.  </t><t><spanx style="strong" xml:space="preserve">NOTE:</spanx> While the format of the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">login_hint</spanx> and <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">login_hint_token</spanx> parameters are not defined by [CIBA] or this profile, implementers may wish to consider https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-secevent-subject-identifiers for a standards based method of communicating user identifiers.  </t></section><section title="Confidential Client" anchor="confidential-client" toc="default"><section title="General Provisions" anchor="general-provisions" toc="default"><t>A Confidential Client shall support the provisions specified in clause 5.2.4 of Financial-grade API - Part 1 [FAPI1] and clause 5.2.4 of Financial-grade API - Part 2 [FAPI2].  </t><t>In addition, the Confidential Client </t><t><list style="numbers"><t>shall only send Signed Authentication Requests as defined in [CIBA] 7.1.1 to the Backchannel Authentication Endpoint; </t><t>shall ensure sufficient authorization context exists in authorization request or shall include a binding_message in the authentication request; and </t><t>shall ensure the Authorization Server has authenticated the user to an appropriate level for the client's intended purpose.  </t></list></t></section></section></section><section title="Extensions to CIBA authentication request" anchor="extensions-to-ciba-authentication-request" toc="default"><t>This profile defines the following extensions to the authentication request defined in [CIBA] section 7.1.  </t><t><list style="numbers"><t><spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">request_context</spanx>: OPTIONAL. a JSON object (the contents of which are not defined by this specification) containing information to inform fraud and threat decisions.

This profile aims to help implementers of [CIBA] for financial-grade APIs to reduce or eliminate these attack vectors. There are however further security considerations that should be taken into account when implementing this specification.  </t></section><section title="Authentication sessions started without a users knowledge or consent" anchor="authentication-sessions-started-without-a-users-knowledge-or-consent" toc="default"><t>As this specification allows the client to initiate an authentication request it is important for the authorization server to know whether the user is aware and has consented to the authentication process. If widely known user identifiers (e.g.  phone numbers) are used as the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">login_hint</spanx> in the authentication request then this risk is worsened. An attacker could start unsolicited authentication sessions on large numbers of authentication devices, causing distress and potentially enabling fraud. For this reason this profile highly recommends <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">login_hint</spanx> to have the properties of a nonce with the expectation being that it will be generated from an authorization server owned client authentication device. Given the high levels of friction that this may impose it's anticipated that Authorization Servers may have to accept an <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">id_token_hint</spanx> as an alternative mechanism for Client Subject identification.  </t><t>If a client wishes to store the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">id_token</spanx> returned from an authorization server for later use as an <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">id_token_hint</spanx>, care must be taken to ensure that the customer identification mechanism used to retrieve the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">id_token</spanx> is appropriate for the channel being used. For illustration a QR code on a 'club card' may be an appropriate identifier when using a POS terminal under CCTV but it might not be an appropriate identifier when used in online ecommerce.  </t><t>In addition, [CIBA] provides an optional <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">user_code</spanx> mechanism to specifically mitigate this issue, it may be appropriate to require the use of <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">user_code</spanx> in certain deployments.  </t></section><section title="Reliance on user to confirm binding messages" anchor="reliance-on-user-to-confirm-binding-messages" toc="default"><t>Depending on the hint used to identify the user and the Client's user authentication processes, it may be possible for a fraudster to start a malicious [CIBA] flow at the same time as a genuine flow, with both flows using the genuine user&#8217;s identifier. If the scope of access requested is similar then the only way to ensure that a user is authorizing the correct transaction is for the user to compare the binding messages on the Authentication and Consumption devices.  </t><t>If this risk is deemed unacceptable then implementers should either consider alternative mechanisms of verifying the binding message (e.g. conveying it to the Authentication device via a QR code), or use ephemeral user identifiers generated on the Authentication device.  </t></section><section title="Loss of fraud markers to OpenID provider" anchor="loss-of-fraud-markers-to-openid-provider" toc="default"><t>In a redirect-based flow, the authorization server can collect useful fraud markers from the user-agent. In a [CIBA] flow the separation of consumption and authentication devices reduces the data that can be collected. This could reduce the effectiveness of any fraud detection system.  </t></section><section title="Incomplete or incorrect implementations of the specifications" anchor="incomplete-or-incorrect-implementations-of-the-specifications" toc="default"><t>To achieve the full security benefits, it is important the implementation of this specification, and the underlying OpenID Connect and OAuth specifications, are both complete and correct.  </t><t>The OpenID Foundation provides tools that can be used to confirm that an implementation is correct: </t><t>https://openid.net/certification/ </t><t>The OpenID Foundation maintains a list of certified implementations: </t><t>https://openid.net/developers/certified/ </t><t>Deployments that use this specification should use a certified implementation.  </t></section><section title="JWS/JWE Algorithm considerations" anchor="jwsjwe-algorithm-considerations" toc="default"><t>CIBA Authorization Servers and Clients shall follow the guidance around JWT signing and encryption Algorithms in [FAPI2] 8.6 and 8.6.1.  </t></section><section title="Authentication Device security" anchor="authentication-device-security" toc="default"><t>This profile and the underlying specifications do not specify how the Authorization Server should initiate and perform user authentication and authorization of consent on the authentication device.  </t><t>Implementors must use appropriately strong methods to communicate with the authentication device and to authenticate the end user.  </t></section><section title="CIBA token delivery modes" anchor="ciba-token-delivery-modes" toc="default"><t>[CIBA] defines 3 ways that tokens can be delivered to the client.  </t><t>The <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">push</spanx> mode is not permitted by this specification as it delivers tokens to the client by calling an endpoint owned by the client. This substantially differs from the established pattern of retrieving tokens by presenting client authentication to the token endpoint, and it may have security concerns that are currently unknown.  </t><t>The <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">poll</spanx> and <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">ping</spanx> modes both follow the established convention of retrieving tokens from the token endpoint and hence do not have this concern.  </t><t>The <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">ping</spanx> mode delivers a notification to an endpoint owned by the client. The information contained in this notification is limited to the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">auth_req_id</spanx> for the request, as described in [CIBA] 10.2. The bearer token used by the authorization server to access this resource is not sender constrained. If the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">backchannel_client_notification_endpoint</spanx>, the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">auth_req_id</spanx> and the <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">client_notification_token</spanx> are known to an attacker, they may be able to force the client to call the token endpoint repeatedly or before the authentication has completed.
