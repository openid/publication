      <t>
	In OpenID Connect, the session at the RP typically starts when the RP
	validates the End-User's ID Token.
	Refer to the OpenID Connect Core 1.0 <xref target="OpenID.Core"/>
	specification to find
	out how to obtain an ID Token and validate it. 
	When the OP supports session management, it MUST also return the Session State
	as an additional <spanx style="verb">session_state</spanx> parameter
	in the Authorization Response.
	The OpenID Connect Authorization Response is specified in Section 3.1.2.5 of
	OpenID Connect Core 1.0.
      </t>

      <t>This parameter is:</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="ChangeNotification" title="Session Status Change Notification">
      <t>
	An ID Token typically comes with an expiration date. The RP MAY rely on it
	to expire the RP session. However, it is entirely possible that the End-User
	might have logged out of the OP before the expiration date. Therefore, it is
	highly desirable to be able to find out the login status of the End-User at
	the OP.
      </t>
      <t>
	To do so, it is possible to repeat the authentication request with
	<spanx style="verb">prompt=none</spanx>.
	However, this causes network traffic and this is
	problematic on the mobile devices that are becoming increasingly
	popular. Therefore, once the session is established with the
	authentication request and response, it is desirable to be able to check
	the login status at the OP without causing network traffic by polling
	a hidden OP iframe from an RP iframe with an origin restricted postMessage
	as follows.
      </t>

      <section anchor="RPiframe" title="RP iframe">

        <t>The RP loads an invisible iframe from itself.
        This iframe MUST know the ID of the OP iframe,
	as described in <xref target="OPiframe"/>, so that it can
        postMessage to the OP iframe.</t>

        <t>
	  The RP iframe polls the OP iframe with postMessage at an interval
	  suitable for the RP application. With each postMessage, it sends the
	  session state defined in <xref target="OPiframe"/>.
	</t>

        <t>
	  The postMessage from the RP iframe delivers the
	  following concatenation as the data:

	  <list style="symbols">
            <t>Client ID + " " + Session State</t>
          </list>
	</t>

	<t>
	  It also has to be able to
	  receive the postMessage back from the OP iframe. The received data
	  will either be <spanx style='verb'>changed</spanx> or
	  <spanx style='verb'>unchanged</spanx>.  Upon receipt of
	  <spanx style='verb'>changed</spanx>, the RP MUST perform re-authentication with 
	  <spanx style='verb'>prompt=none</spanx> to obtain the current 
	  session state at the OP.
	</t>

        <t>
	  Following is non-normative example pseudo-code for the RP iframe:

            <artwork><![CDATA[
  var stat = "unchanged";
  var mes = client_id + " " + session_state;

  function check_session()
  {
    var targetOrigin  = "http://server.example.com";
    var win = window.parent.document.getElementById("op").

    if stat == "changed" then take the actions below...
  }
]]></artwork>
          </figure>
	</t>
	<t>
	  When the RP detects a session state change, it SHOULD first
	  try a <spanx style="verb">prompt=none</spanx> request
	  within an iframe to obtain a
	  new ID Token and session state, sending the old ID Token as
	  the <spanx style="verb">id_token_hint</spanx>. 
	  If the RP receives an ID token for the same End-User, it SHOULD
	  simply update the value of the session state.  If it doesn't
	  receive an ID token or receives an ID token for another
	  End-User, then it needs to handle this case as a logout for the
	  original End-User.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Note that the session state is origin bound.
	  Session state SHOULD be returned upon an authorization failure.

          </figure>
	</t>
	<t>
	  The OP browser state is typically going to be stored in a
	  cookie or HTML5 local storage.  It is origin bound to the
	  Authorization Server.  It captures meaningful events such as
	  logins, logouts, change of user,
	  change of authorization status for Clients being used by the End-User,
	  etc.  Thus, the OP SHOULD
	  update the value of the browser state in response to such
	  meaningful events. As a result, the next call to
	  check_session() after such an event will return the
	  value <spanx style='verb'>changed</spanx>.
	  It is RECOMMENDED that the OP not update
	  the browser state too frequently in the absence of
	  meaningful events so as to spare excessive network traffic
	  at the Client in response to spurious <spanx style='verb'>changed</spanx> events.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The computation of the session state returned in response to
	  unsuccessful Authorization Requests SHOULD, in addition to
	  the browser state, incorporate sufficient randomness in the
	  form of a salt so as to prevent identification of an End-User
	  across successive calls to the OP's Authorization Endpoint.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In the case of an authorized Client (successful
	  Authorization Response), the OP SHOULD change the value of
	  the session state returned to the Client under one of the
	  following events:

	  <list style="symbols">
	    <t>
	      The set of users authenticated to the browser changes
	      (login, logout, session add).
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The authorization status of Clients being used by the End-User changes.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
	<t>
	  In addition, the browser state used to verify the session state
	  SHOULD change with such events.
	  Calls to check_session() will return <spanx style='verb'>changed</spanx>
	  against earlier versions of session state after such events.
	  It is RECOMMENDED that the browser state SHOULD NOT vary too
	  frequently in the absence of such events to minimize network
	  traffic caused by the Client's response to <spanx style='verb'>changed</spanx>
	  notifications.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In the case of an unsuccessful Authorization Request, the
	  value of the session state returned SHOULD vary with each
	  request. However, the browser session state need not change
	  unless a meaningful event happens. In particular, many
	  values of session state can be simultaneously valid, for
	  instance by the introduction of random salt in the session
	  states issued in response to unsuccessful Authorization Requests.
	</t>
	<t>
	  If a cookie is used to maintain the OP browser state,
	  the HttpOnly flag likely can't be set for this cookie,
	  because it needs to be accessed from JavaScript.
	  Therefore, information that can be used for identifying the user
	  should not be put into the cookie, as it could be read by unrelated JavaScript.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In some implementations, <spanx style='verb'>changed</spanx>
	  notifications will occur only when changes to the End-User's
	  session occur, whereas in other implementations, they might
	  also occur as a result of changes to other sessions between
	  the User Agent and the OP.
	  RPs need to be prepared for either eventuality,
	  silently handling any false positives that might occur.
