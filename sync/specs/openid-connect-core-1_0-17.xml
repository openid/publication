      <t>
	OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
	<xref target="RFC6749"/>
	protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based
	on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to
	obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and 
	REST-like manner.
      </t>
      <t>
	The OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification defines
	the core OpenID Connect functionality:
	authentication built on top of OAuth 2.0 and
	the use of Claims to communicate information about the End-User.
	It also describes the security and privacy considerations for using OpenID Connect.
      </t>

      <t>
	As background,
	the <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework</xref>
	and <xref target="RFC6750">OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage</xref>
	specifications provide a general framework for third-party applications
	to obtain and use limited access to HTTP resources.  They define
	mechanisms to obtain and use Access Tokens to access resources but
	do not define standard methods to provide identity information.
	Notably, without profiling OAuth 2.0, it is incapable of
	providing information about the authentication of an End-User.
	Readers are expected to be familiar with these specifications.
      </t>
      <t>
	OpenID Connect implements authentication as an extension to the
	OAuth 2.0 authorization process.
	Use of this extension is requested by Clients by including
	the <spanx style="verb">openid</spanx> scope value
	in the Authorization Request.
	Information about the authentication performed is returned
	in a <xref target="JWT">JSON Web Token (JWT)</xref>
	called an ID Token (see <xref target="IDToken"/>).
	OAuth 2.0 Authentication Servers implementing OpenID Connect
	are also referred to as OpenID Providers (OPs).
	OAuth 2.0 Clients using OpenID Connect
	are also referred to as Relying Parties (RPs).
      </t>
      <t>
	This specification assumes that the Relying Party has already obtained
	configuration information about the OpenID Provider, including its
	Authorization Endpoint and Token Endpoint locations.
	This information is normally obtained via Discovery,
	as described in <xref target="OpenID.Discovery">OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0</xref>,
	or may be obtained via other mechanisms.
      </t>
      <t>
	Likewise, this specification assumes that the Relying Party has already obtained
	sufficient credentials and provided information needed to use the OpenID Provider.
	This is normally done via Dynamic Registration,
	as described in
	<xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0</xref>,
	or may be obtained via other mechanisms.
      </t>

    <section anchor="IDToken" title="ID Token">

      <t>
	The primary extension that OpenID Connect makes to OAuth 2.0
	to enable End-Users to be Authenticated
	is the ID Token data structure.
	The ID Token is a security token that contains Claims about the
	Authentication of an End-User by an Authorization Server when using a Client,
	and potentially other requested Claims.
	The ID Token is represented as a
	<xref target="JWT">JSON Web Token (JWT)</xref>.
      </t>
      <t>
	The following Claims are used within the ID Token
	for all OAuth 2.0 flows used by OpenID Connect:
      </t>

      <t>
	<list style="hanging">
	  <t hangText="iss">
	    REQUIRED.
	    Issuer Identifier for the Issuer of the response.
	    The <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> value is a case sensitive URL
	    using the <spanx style="verb">https</spanx> scheme that
	    contains scheme, host, and optionally, port number and path
	    components and no query or fragment components.
	  </t>

	  <t hangText="sub">
	    REQUIRED.
	    Subject Identifier.  A locally unique and never

	    which is intended to be consumed by the Client,
	    e.g., <spanx style="verb">24400320</spanx>
	    or <spanx style="verb">AItOawmwtWwcT0k51BayewNvutrJUqsvl6qs7A4</spanx>.
	    It MUST NOT exceed 255 ASCII characters in length.
	    The <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> value is a case sensitive string.
	  </t>

	  <t hangText="aud">

	    Audience(s) that this ID Token is intended for.
	    It MUST contain the OAuth 2.0 <spanx style="verb">client_id</spanx>
	    of the Relying Party as an audience value.
	    It MAY also contain identifiers for other audiences.
	    In the general case,
	    the <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx> value is an array of
	    case sensitive strings.
	    In the common special case when there is one audience,
	    the <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx> value MAY be a single

	OpenID Connect performs authentication to log in the End-User
	or to determine that the End-User is already logged in.
	OpenID Connect returns the result of the Authentication
	performed by the Server to the Client in a secure manner
	so that the Client can rely on it.
	For this reason, the Client is called Relying Party (RP) in this case.
      </t>
      <t>
	The Authentication result is returned in an

	The Authorization Server can also
	authenticate the Client before exchanging the Authorization Code for an

	    <xref target="JWT">JSON Web Token (JWT)</xref> specification.
	    Alternatively, Private Claim Names can be safely used

      <section anchor="ClaimsLanguagesAndScripts" title="Claims Languages and Scripts">
	<t>
	  Human-readable Claim Values and Claim Values that reference human-readable values
	  MAY be represented in multiple languages and scripts.
	  To specify the languages and scripts, <xref
	  target="RFC5646">BCP47</xref> language tags are added to member names,
	  delimited by a <spanx style="verb">#</spanx> character.  For example,
	  <spanx style="verb">family_name#ja-Kana-JP</spanx> expresses the
	  Family Name in Katakana in Japanese, which is commonly used to index
	  and represent the phonetics of the Kanji representation of the same
	  represented as <spanx style="verb">family_name#ja-Hani-JP</spanx>.
	  As another example, both <spanx style="verb">website</spanx> and
	  <spanx style="verb">website#de</spanx> Claim Values might be returned,
	  referencing a Web site in an unspecified language and a Web site
	  in German.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Since Claim Names are case sensitive, it is strongly RECOMMENDED
	  that language tag values used in Claim Names be spelled using the
	  character case with which they are registered in the
	  <xref target="IANA.Language">IANA Language Subtag Registry</xref>.
	  In particular, normally language names are spelled with lowercase characters,
	  region names are spelled with uppercase characters, and
	  scripts are spelled with mixed case characters.
	  However, since BCP47 language tag values are case insensitive,
	  implementations SHOULD interpret the language tag values supplied
	  in a case insensitive manner.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Per the recommendations in BCP47, language tag values for Claims
	  SHOULD only be as specific as necessary.
	  For instance, using <spanx style="verb">fr</spanx> might be sufficient
	  in many contexts, rather than <spanx style="verb">fr-CA</spanx> or
	  <spanx style="verb">fr-FR</spanx>.
	  Where possible, OPs SHOULD try to match requested Claim locales with
	  Claims it has.  For instance, if the Client asks for a Claim with
	  a <spanx style="verb">de</spanx> (German) language tag and the OP
	  has a value tagged with <spanx style="verb">de-CH</spanx> (Swiss German)
	  and no generic German value, it would be appropriate for the OP
	  to return the Swiss German value to the Client.
	  (This intentionally moves as much of the complexity of language tag
	  matching to the OP as possible, to simplify Clients.)
	</t>
	<t>
	  OpenID Connect defines the following Authorization Request parameter
	  to enable specify the preferred languages and scripts to be used

	<t>
	  When the OP determines, either through the
	  <spanx style="verb">claims_locales</spanx> parameter,

	  requesting Claims in only one set of languages and scripts,
	  it is RECOMMENDED that OPs return Claims without language tags
	  when they employ this language and script.
	  It is also RECOMMENDED that Clients be written in a manner

		    The default is <spanx style="verb">false</spanx>.
		  </t>
		  <t>
		    By requesting Claims as Essential Claims,
		    the RP indicates to the End-User
		    that releasing these Claims will ensure a smooth authorization
		    for the specific task requested by the End-User.
		    Note that even if the Claims are not available because
		    the End-User did not authorize their release or they are not present,
		    the Authorization Server MUST NOT generate an error when
		    Claims are not returned, whether they are Essential or Voluntary,
		    unless otherwise specified in the description of the specific claim.
		  </t>

		  <t hangText="value">
		    OPTIONAL.
		    Requests that the Claim be returned with a particular value.

	  <spanx style="verb">email</spanx> address for a given End-User MAY change 
	  over time.
	  Therefore, other Claims such as <spanx style="verb">email</spanx>,

    <section anchor="JWTRequests" title="Passing Request Parameters as JWTs">

      <t>
	OpenID Connect defines the following Authorization Request parameters
	to enable Authentication Requests to be signed and optionally encrypted:

	<list style="hanging">
	  <t hangText="request">
	    OPTIONAL.
	    This parameter enables
	    OpenID Connect requests to be passed in a single,
	    self-contained parameter and to be optionally signed and/or encrypted.
	    The parameter value is a Request Object value,
	    as specified in <xref target="RequestObject"/>.
	    It represents the request as a JWT whose Claims
	    are the request parameters.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="request_uri">
	    OPTIONAL.
	    This parameter enables
	    OpenID Connect requests to be passed by reference, rather than by value.
	    The <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> value is a URL
	    using the <spanx style="verb">https</spanx> scheme
	    referencing a resource containing a Request Object value,
	    which is a JWT containing the request parameters.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>
      <t>
	Requests using these parameters are represented as JWTs, which are respectively
	passed by value or by reference.
	The ability to pass requests by reference is particularly useful for large requests.
	If one of these parameters is used,
	the other MUST NOT be used in the same request.
      </t>

      <section title="Passing a Request Object by Value" anchor="RequestObject">

	<t>
	  The <spanx style="verb">request</spanx> Authorization Request parameter
	  enables OpenID Connect requests to be passed in a single,
	  self-contained parameter and to be optionally signed and/or encrypted.
	  It represents the request as a JWT whose Claims are the request parameters
	  specified in <xref target="AuthorizationEndpoint"/>.
	  This JWT is called a Request Object.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Support for the <spanx style="verb">request</spanx> parameter is OPTIONAL.
	  The <spanx style="verb">request_parameter_supported</spanx>
	  Discovery result indicates whether the OP supports this parameter.
	  Should an OP not support this parameter and an RP uses it,
	  the OP MUST return the <spanx style="verb">request_not_supported</spanx>
	  error.
	</t>
	<t>
	  When the <spanx style="verb">request</spanx> parameter is used,
	  the OpenID Connect request parameter values contained in the JWT
	  supersede those passed using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax.
	  However, parameters MAY also be passed using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax
	  even when a Request Object is used;
	  this would typically be done to enable a cached,
	  pre-signed (and possibly pre-encrypted) Request Object value
	  to be used containing the fixed request parameters, while parameters that
	  can vary with each request, such as <spanx style="verb">state</spanx> and
	  <spanx style="verb">nonce</spanx>, are passed as OAuth 2.0 parameters.
	</t>
	<t>
	  So that the request is a valid OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request,
	  values for the <spanx style="verb">response_type</spanx> and
	  <spanx style="verb">client_id</spanx> parameters MUST be included
	  using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax, since they are REQUIRED by OAuth 2.0.
	  The values for these parameters MUST match those in the Request Object,
	  if present.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Even if a <spanx style="verb">scope</spanx> parameter
	  is present in the Request Object value,
	  a <spanx style="verb">scope</spanx> parameter MUST always be passed using
	  the OAuth 2.0 request syntax containing the
	  <spanx style="verb">openid</spanx> scope value to indicate to the
	  underlying OAuth 2.0 logic that this is an OpenID Connect request.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The Request Object MAY be signed or unsigned (plaintext).
	  When it is plaintext, this is indicated by use of the
	  <spanx style="verb">none</spanx> algorithm <xref target="JWA" />
	  in the JWS header.  If signed, the Request Object
	  SHOULD contain the Claims
	  <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> (issuer)
	  and <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx> (audience) as members.
	  The <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> value SHOULD be the Client ID of the RP,
	  unless it was signed by a different party than the RP.
	  The <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx> value SHOULD be or include
	  the OP's Issuer Identifier URL.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The Request Object MAY also be encrypted using <xref target="JWE">JWE</xref>
	  and MAY be encrypted without also being signed.
	  If both signing and encryption are performed, it MUST be signed then encrypted,
	  with the result being a Nested JWT, as defined in <xref target="JWT"/>.
	</t>
	<t>
	  <spanx style="verb">request</spanx> and
	  <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> parameters
	  MUST NOT be included in Request Objects.

      <section anchor="RequestUriParameter" title="Passing a Request Object by Reference">
	<t>
	  The <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> Authorization Request parameter enables
	  OpenID Connect requests to be passed by reference, rather than by value.
	  This parameter is used identically to the
	  <spanx style="verb">request</spanx> parameter, other than that
	  the Request Object value is retrieved from the resource at the specified URL,
	  rather than passed by value.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The <spanx style="verb">request_uri_parameter_supported</spanx>
	  Discovery result indicates whether the OP supports this parameter.
	  Should an OP not support this parameter and an RP uses it,
	  the OP MUST return the <spanx style="verb">request_uri_not_supported</spanx>
	  error.
	</t>
	<t>
	  When the <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> parameter is used,
	  the OpenID Connect request parameter values contained in the referenced JWT
	  supersede those passed using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax.
	  However, parameters MAY also be passed using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax

	  <spanx style="verb">openid</spanx> scope value to indicate to the
	  underlying OAuth 2.0 logic that this is an OpenID Connect request.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Servers MAY cache the contents of the resources referenced by Request URIs.
	  If the contents of the referenced resource could ever change,
	  the URI SHOULD include the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash of the
	  referenced resource contents as the fragment component of the URI.
	  If the fragment value used for a URI changes, that signals the server
	  that any cached value for that URI with the old fragment value
	  is no longer valid.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Note that Clients MAY pre-register
	  <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> values using the
	  <spanx style="verb">request_uris</spanx> parameter defined in
	  Section 2.1 of the
	  <xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0</xref>
	  specification.
	  OPs can require that <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> values used
	  be pre-registered with the <spanx style="verb">require_request_uri_registration</spanx>
	  discovery parameter.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The entire Request URI MUST NOT exceed 512 ASCII characters.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The contents of the resource referenced by the URL MUST be a Request Object.
	  The scheme used in the 
	  <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> value MUST be <spanx style="verb">https</spanx>, 
	  unless the target Request Object is signed in a way that is verifiable by the 
	  Authorization Server.
	  The <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> value MUST be reachable by the

	<section anchor="RequestUriRationale" title="&quot;request_uri&quot; Rationale">
	  <t>
	    There are several reasons that one might choose to use the
	    <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> parameter:
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    <list style="numbers">
	      <t>
		The set of request parameters can become large, and can exceed browser
		URI size limitations.  Passing the request parameters by reference
		can solve this problem.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Passing a <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> value, rather than
		a complete request by value, can reduce request latency.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Most requests for Claims from an RP are constant.
		The <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> is a way of creating
		and sometimes also signing and encrypting a constant set of
		request parameters in advance.
		(The <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> value becomes an "artifact"
		representing a particular fixed set of request parameters.)
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Pre-registering a fixed set of request parameters at Registration time
		enables OPs to cache and pre-validate the request parameters at
		Registration time, meaning they need not be retrieved at request time.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Pre-registering a fixed set of request parameters at
		Registration time enables OPs to vet the contents of
		the request from consumer protection and other points
		of views, either itself or by utilizing a third party.

	<t>
	  When the <spanx style="verb">request</spanx> or

	  Authentication Request beyond those specified in
	  Sections <xref target="AuthRequestValidation" format="counter"/>,
	  <xref target="ImplicitValidation" format="counter"/>, or
	  <xref target="HybridValidation" format="counter"/>.

	    these are used by the Client to encrypt the JWT.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    The Authorization Server MUST decrypt the JWT in accordance with
	    the <xref target="JWE">JSON Web Encryption</xref> specification.
	    The result MAY be either a signed or unsigned (plaintext) Request Object. 
	    In the former case, signature validation MUST be performed

    <section anchor="SubjectIDTypes" title="Subject Identifier Types">
      <t>
	A Subject Identifier is a locally unique and never
	reassigned identifier within the Issuer for the End-User, 
	which is intended to be consumed by the Client.
	Two Subject Identifier types are defined by this specification:

	<list style="hanging">
	  <t hangText="public">
	    This provides the same <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> (subject) value to all Clients.
	    It is the default if the provider has no <spanx style="verb">subject_types_supported</spanx>
	    element in its discovery document.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="pairwise">
	    This provides a different <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx>
	    value to each Client, so as not to enable Clients to correlate
	    the End-User's activities without permission.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>
      <t>
	The OpenID Provider's Discovery document SHOULD list
	its supported Subject Identifier types in the
	<spanx style="verb">subject_types_supported</spanx> element.
	If there is more than one type listed in the array, the Client MAY elect to
	provide its preferred identifier type using the
	<spanx style="verb">subject_type</spanx> parameter during Registration.
      </t>

      <section anchor="PairwiseAlg" title="Pairwise Identifier Algorithm">

	<t>
	  When pairwise Subject Identifiers are used,
	  the OpenID Provider MUST calculate a unique
	  <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> (subject) value for each
	  Sector Identifier.  The Subject Identifier value MUST NOT be reversible
	  by any party other than the OpenID Provider.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Providers that use pairwise <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> values
	  and support
	  <xref target="OpenID.Registration">Dynamic Client Registration</xref>
	  SHOULD use the <spanx style="verb">sector_identifier_uri</spanx> parameter.
	  It provides a way for a group of websites under common administrative 
	  control to have consistent pairwise <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> 
	  values independent of the individual domain names.
	  It also provides a way for Clients to change 
	  <spanx style="verb">redirect_uri</spanx> domains without having to 
	  reregister all of their users.
	</t>

	<t>If the Client has not provided a value for
	<spanx style="verb">sector_identifier_uri</spanx> in 
	<xref target="OpenID.Registration">Dynamic Client Registration</xref>,
	the Sector Identifier
	used for pairwise identifier calculation is the host component 
	of the registered <spanx style="verb">redirect_uri</spanx>.
	If there are multiple hostnames in the registered
	<spanx style="verb">redirect_uris</spanx>, the Client MUST register a 
	<spanx style="verb">sector_identifier_uri</spanx>.</t>

	<t>When a <spanx style="verb">sector_identifier_uri</spanx>
	is provided, the host component of that URL is used as
	the Sector Identifier for the pairwise identifier calculation.
	The value of the <spanx style="verb">sector_identifier_uri</spanx>
	MUST be a URL using the <spanx style="verb">https</spanx> scheme that points to
	a JSON file containing an array of
	<spanx style="verb">redirect_uri</spanx> values.
	The values of the registered <spanx style="verb">redirect_uris</spanx>
	MUST be included in the elements of the array.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Any algorithm with the following properties
	  can be used by OpenID Providers to
	  calculate pairwise Subject Identifiers:

	  <list style="symbols">

	      The Subject Identifier value MUST NOT be reversible
	      by any party other than the OpenID Provider.

	      Distinct Sector Identifier values MUST result in

	      The Sector Identifier can be concatenated with a local account ID and a salt

	    One method to achieve this for Web Server Clients is to store a cryptographically random value

	  An Attacker might generate a bogus token or modify the token contents

	  The server response disclosure can be mitigated in the following two
	  ways:
	  <list style="numbers">
	    <t>Using the <spanx style="verb">code</spanx> Response Type.

      </section>

      <section anchor="AuthCodeCapture"
	       title=" Eavesdropping or Leaking Authorization Codes (Secondary Authenticator Capture)">
	<t>In addition to the attack patterns described in
	Section 4.4.1.1 of <xref target="RFC6819"/>,
	an Authorization Code can be captured in the User Agent where the TLS
	session is terminated if the User Agent is infected by malware.
	However, capturing it is not useful as long as either
	Client Authentication or an encrypted response is used.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="TokenSubstitution" title="Token Substitution">
	<t>
	  Token Substitution is a class of attacks in which a malicious user
	  swaps various tokens, including swapping an Authorization Code for
	  a legitimate user with another token that the attacker has.
	  One means of accomplishing this is for the attacker to copy
	  a token out one session and use it in an HTTP message for
	  a different session, which is easy to do when the token is
	  available to the browser; this is known as the "cut and paste" attack.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The Implicit Flow of <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0</xref>
	  is not designed to mitigate this risk.  In Section 10.16,
	  it normatively requires that any use of the authorization
	  process as a form of delegated End-User authentication to the
	  Client MUST NOT use the Implicit Flow without employing
	  additional security mechanisms that enable the Client to
	  determine whether the ID Token and Access Token were issued for its use.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In OpenID Connect, this is mitigated through mechanisms
	  provided through the ID Token.  The ID Token is a signed
	  security token that provides Claims such as
	  <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> (issuer),
	  <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> (subject),
	  <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx> (audience),
	  <spanx style="verb">azp</spanx> (authorized party),
	  <spanx style="verb">at_hash</spanx> (access token hash), and
	  <spanx style="verb">c_hash</spanx> (code hash).  Using the ID Token,
	  the Client is capable of detecting the Token Substitution Attack.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The <spanx style="verb">c_hash</spanx> in the ID Token enables
	  Clients to prevent Authorization Code substitution.
	  The <spanx style="verb">at_hash</spanx> in the ID Token enables
	  Clients to prevent Access Token substitution.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Also, a malicious user may attempt to impersonate a more
	  privileged user by subverting the communication channel
	  between the Authorization Endpoint and Client, or the Token Endpoint
	  and Client, for example by swapping the Authorization Code
	  or reordering the messages, to convince the Token Endpoint
	  that the attacker's authorization grant corresponds to a grant
	  sent on behalf of a more privileged user.
	</t>
	<t>
	  For the HTTP binding defined by this specification, the
	  responses to Token Requests are bound to the corresponding
	  requests by message order in HTTP, as both the response
	  containing the token and requests are protected by TLS, which
	  will detect and prevent packet reordering.
	</t>
	<t>
	  When designing another binding of this specification to a
	  protocol incapable of strongly binding Token Endpoint
	  requests to responses, additional mechanisms to
	  address this issue MUST be utilized. One such mechanism could
	  be to include an ID Token with a <spanx style="verb">c_hash</spanx>
	  Claim in the token request and response.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="TimingAttack" title="Timing Attack">
	<t>A timing attack enables the attacker to 
	obtain an unnecessary large amount of information through the elapsed time 
	differences in the code paths taken by successful and unsuccessful decryption operations or
	successful and unsuccessful signature validation of a message. 
	It can be used to reduce the effective key length of the

      <section anchor="SigningOrder" title="Signing and Encryption Order">
	<t>
	  Signatures over encrypted text are not considered valid
	  in many jurisdictions.
	  Therefore, for integrity and non-repudiation,
	  this specification requires signing 
	  the plain text JSON Claims, when signing is performed.
	  If both signing and encryption are desired, it is performed on
	  the JWS containing the signed Claims,
	  with the result being a Nested JWT, as specified in <xref target="JWT"/>.
	  Note that since all JWE encryption algorithms provide integrity protection,
	  there is no need to separately sign the encrypted content.

      <section anchor="IssuerIdentifier" title="Issuer Identifier">
	<t>OpenID Connect supports multiple Issuers per Host and Port combination.
	The issuer returned by discovery MUST exactly match the value of 
	<spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> in the ID Token.</t>

	<t>
	  OpenID Connect treats the path component of any Issuer URI as
	  being part of the Issuer Identifier.  For instance, the subject
	  "1234" with an Issuer Identifier of "https://example.com" is not
	  equivalent to the subject "1234" with an Issuer Identifier of
	  "https://example.com/sales".
	</t>
	<t>
	  It is RECOMMENDED that only a single Issuer per host be used.

	  Also, <spanx style="verb">client_secret</spanx> values MUST also contain

	  particular algorithm used.
	  So for instance, for <spanx style="verb">HS256</spanx>, the

      <section anchor="OfflineAccessPrivacy" title="Offline Access">

	<t>
	  Offline access enables access to Claims when the user is not present,
	  posing greater privacy risk than the Claims transfer when the user is present.
	  Therefore, it is prudent to obtain explicit consent for
	  offline access to resources.
	  This specification mandates the use of the <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx>
	  parameter to obtain consent unless it is already known that the
	  request complies with the conditions for processing the request in each jurisdiction.
	</t>
	<t>
	  When an Access Token is returned via the User Agent
	  using the Implicit Flow or Hybrid Flow, there is
	  a greater risk of it being exposed to an attacker, who could
	  later use it to access the UserInfo endpoint.
	  If the Access Token does not enable offline access and the server
	  can differentiate whether the Client request has been made
	  offline or online, the risk will be substantially reduced.
	  Therefore, this specification mandates ignoring
	  the offline access request when the Access Token is
	  transmitted through the User Agent.
	  Note that differentiating between online and offline access
	  from the server can be difficult especially for native clients.
	  The server may well have to rely on heuristics.
	  Also, the risk of exposure for the Access Token delivered
	  through the User Agent for the Response Types of
	  <spanx style="verb">code&nbsp;token</spanx> and
	  <spanx style="verb">token</spanx> is the same.
	  Thus, the implementations should be prepared to detect
	  whether the Access Token was issued through the User Agent
	  or directly from the Token Endpoint and deny offline access
	  if the token was issued through the User Agent.

	<t>
	  Note that although these provisions require an explicit
	  consent dialogue through the <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx> parameter,
	  the mere fact that the user pressed an "accept" button etc.,
	  might not constitute a valid consent.
	  Developers should be aware that for the act of consent to
	  be valid, typically, the impact of the terms have to be
	  understood by the End-User, the consent must be freely given
	  and not forced (i.e., other options have to be available),
	  and the terms must fair and equitable.
	  In general, it is advisable for the service to follow the
	  required privacy principles in each jurisdiction and rely on
	  other conditions for processing the request than simply explicit consent,
	  as online self-service "explicit consent" often does not
	  form a valid consent in some jurisdictions.

	  The value of the <spanx style="verb">id_token</spanx> parameter is the ID Token,
	  which is a signed JWT,
	  containing three base64url encoded segments separated by period ('.') characters.
	  The first segment represents the JWT header.
	  Base64url decoding it will result in the following set of Header Parameters:

	<t>
	  The <spanx style="verb">alg</spanx> value represents the algorithm
	  that was used to sign the JWT, in this case
	  <spanx style="verb">RS256</spanx>, representing RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5 using SHA-256.
	  The <spanx style="verb">kid</spanx> value is a key identifier used
	  in identifying the key to be used to verify the signature.
	  If the <spanx style="verb">kid</spanx> value is unknown to the RP,
	  it needs to retrieve the contents of the OP's JWK Set again
	  to obtain the OP's current set of keys.
