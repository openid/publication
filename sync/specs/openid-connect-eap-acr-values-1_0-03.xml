	The following Authentication Context Class Reference values
	are defined by this specification:

	<list style="hanging">

	  <t hangText="phr">
	    <vspace/>
	    Phishing-Resistant.
	    An authentication mechanism where a party potentially under
	    the control of the Relying Party cannot gain sufficient
	    information to be able to successfully authenticate to the End
	    User's OpenID Provider as if that party were the End User. (Note
	    that the potentially malicious Relying Party controls where the
	    User-Agent is redirected to and thus may not send it to the End
	    User's actual OpenID Provider).
	    NOTE:  These semantics are the same as those specified in <xref target="OpenID.PAPE"/>.
	  </t>

	  <t hangText="phrh">
	    <vspace/>
	    Phishing-Resistant Hardware-Protected.
	    An authentication mechanism meeting the requirements for
	    phishing-resistant authentication above in which additionally
	    information needed to be able to successfully authenticate to the End
	    User's OpenID Provider as if that party were the End User
	    is held in a hardware-protected device or component.
	  </t>

	</list>

    <section anchor="amrValue" title="Authentication Method Reference Value">
      <t>
	The IANA "Authentication Method Reference Values" registry <xref target="IANA.AMR"/>
	established by <xref target="RFC8176"/>
	contains Authentication Method Reference values to use in
	the <spanx style="verb">amr</spanx> (Authentication Methods References) claim
	<xref target="OpenID.Core"/>.
	The following Authentication Method Reference value
	is defined by this specification:

	<list style="hanging">

	  <t hangText="pop">
	    <vspace/>
	    Proof-of-possession of a key.
	    Unlike the existing <spanx style="verb">hwk</spanx>
	    and <spanx style="verb">swk</spanx> methods,
	    it is unspecified whether the proof-of-possession key is
	    hardware-secured or software-secured.
	  </t>

	</list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
	Per commonly accepted security practices, it should be noted that
	the overall strength of any authentication is only as strong as its
	weakest step. It is thus recommended that provisioning of
	phishing-resistant and other credentials stronger than shared secrets
	should be accomplished using methods that are at least as strong as the
	credential being provisioned. By counter-example, allowing people to
	retrieve a phishing-resistant credential using only a phishable shared
	secret negates much of the value provided by the phishing-resistant
	credential itself.
	Similarly, sometimes using a phishing-resistant method when a
	phishable method continues to also sometimes be employed may still
	enable phishing attacks to compromise the authentication.
      </t>
      <t>
	The downgrade attack described in Section 10.5 of <xref target="RFC9101"/>
	can be prevented by using signed requests, as defined in
	Section 6 of <xref target="OpenID.Core"/> and <xref target="RFC9101"/>.
	In particular, using signed requests prevents modification or removal
	of the <spanx style="verb">acr_values</spanx> request parameter.
      </t>
      <t>
	It is the responsibility of the Relying Party to validate that the value of
	any <spanx style="verb">acr</spanx> (Authentication Context Class Reference)
	claim received meets its requirements,
	including that an <spanx style="verb">acr</spanx> claim is provided,
	when required.
	In particular, if the RP's request included an
	<spanx style="verb">acr_values</spanx> request parameter,
	it should verify that any <spanx style="verb">acr</spanx> value received
	is in the set requested
	or that it is otherwise compatible with its authentication requirements.
