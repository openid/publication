<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>Since OIDF FAPI 2.0 aims at providing an API protection profile for high-risk
scenarios, clearly defined security requirements are indispensable. In this
document, the security requirements are expressed through security goals and
attacker models. From these requirements, the security mechanisms utilized in
the Security Profile are derived.</t>
<t>Implementers and users of the Security Profile can derive from this document
which threats have been taken into consideration by the Security Profile and
which fall outside of what the Security Profile can provide.</t>
<t>The ultimate aim is to provide systematic proofs of the security of the FAPI
profiles similar to those in <xref target="arXiv.1901.11520"></xref>. Formal proofs can rule out
large classes of attacks rooted in the logic of security protocols. Until such
proofs are provided for the FAPI 2.0 Security Profile, the attacker model laid
out herein informs the design decisions, but, as with most security protocols,
there is no guarantee that all attacks for all types of attackers are excluded.</t>
<t>The security requirements in this document are expressed in a form that lends
itself well to a transfer into a formal representation required for an automated
or manual analysis of the security of FAPI. This work draws from the attacker
model and security goals formulated in <xref target="arXiv.1901.11520"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="security-goals"><name>Security Goals</name>
<t>In the following, the security goals for the FAPI 2.0 Security Profile with
regards to authorization and, when OpenID Connect is used, authentication, are
defined.</t>

<section anchor="authorization"><name>Authorization</name>
<t>The FAPI 2.0 Security Profile aims to ensure that <strong>no attacker can
access protected resources</strong> other than their own.</t>
<t>The access token is the ultimate credential for access to resources in
OAuth. Therefore, this security goal is fulfilled if no attacker can
successfully obtain and use an access token for access to protected
resources other than their own.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="authentication"><name>Authentication</name>
<t>The FAPI 2.0 Security Profile aims to ensure that <strong>no attacker is
able to log in at a client under the identity of another user.</strong></t>
<t>The ID token is the credential for authentication in OpenID Connect.
This security goal therefore is fulfilled if no attacker can obtain and
use an ID token identifying another user for login.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="session-integrity"><name>Session Integrity</name>
<t>Session Integrity is concerned with attacks where a user is tricked
into logging in under the attacker’s identity or inadvertently using
the resources of the attacker instead of the user’s own resources.
Attacks in this field include CSRF attacks (traditionally defended
against by using “state” in OAuth) and session swapping attacks.</t>
<t>In detail:</t>

<ul>
<li><t>For authentication: The FAPI 2.0 Security Profile aims to ensure that
<strong>no attacker is able to force a user to be logged in under the identity of
the attacker.</strong></t>
</li>
<li><t>For authorization: The FAPI 2.0 Security Profile aims to ensure that
<strong>no attacker is able to force a user to use resources of the attacker.</strong></t>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="attacker-model"><name>Attacker Model</name>
<t>This attacker model defines very broad capabilities for attackers. It is assumed
that attackers will exploit these capabilities to come up with attacks on the
security goals defined above. To provide a very high level of security,
attackers are assumed very powerful, including having access to otherwise
encrypted communication.</t>
<t>This model does intentionally not define concrete threats. For example, an
attacker that has the ability to eavesdrop on an authorization request might be
able to use this capability for various types of attacks posing different
threats, e.g., injecting a modified authorization request. In a complex
protocol like OAuth or OpenID Connect, however, yet unknown types of threats and
variants of existing threats can emerge, as has been shown in the past. In order
to not overlook any potential attacks, FAPI 2.0 therefore aims not to address
concrete, narrow threats, but to exclude any attacks conceivable for the
attacker types listed here. This will be supported by a formal analysis, as
mentioned above.</t>
<t>This attacker model assumes that certain parts of the infrastructure are working
correctly. Failures in these parts likely lead to attacks that are out of the
scope of this attacker model. These areas need to be analyzed separately within
the scope of an application of the FAPI 2.0 security profiles using threat
modelling or other techniques.</t>
<t>For example, if a major flaw in TLS was found that undermines data integrity in
TLS connections, a network attacker (A2, below) would be able to compromise
practically all OAuth and OpenID Connect sessions in various ways. This would be
fatal, as even application-level signing and encryption is based on key
distribution via TLS connections. As another example, if a human error leads to
the disclosure of secret keys for authentication and an attacker would be able
to misuse these credentials, this attack would not be covered by this attacker
model.</t>
<t>The following parts of the infrastructure are out of the scope of this
attacker model:</t>

<ul>
<li><t><strong>TLS:</strong> It is assumed that TLS connections are not broken, i.e.,
data integrity and confidentiality are ensured. The correct public
keys are used to establish connections and private keys are not
known to attackers (except for explicitly compromised parties).</t>
</li>
<li><t><strong>JWKS:</strong> Where applicable, key distribution mechanisms work as
intended, i.e., encryption and signature verification keys of
uncompromised parties are retrieved from the correct endpoints.</t>
</li>
<li><t><strong>Browsers and Endpoints:</strong> Devices and
browsers used by resource owners are considered not compromised. Other
endpoints not controlled by an attacker behave according to the
protocol.</t>
</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section anchor="attackers"><name>Attackers</name>
<t>FAPI 2.0 profiles aim to ensure the security goals listed above for arbitrary
combinations of the following attackers, potentially collaborating to reach a
common goal:</t>

<section anchor="a1-web-attacker"><name>A1 - Web Attacker</name>
<t>Standard web attacker model. Can send and receive messages just like any other
party controlling one or more endpoints on the internet. Can participate in
protocols flows as a normal user. Can use arbitrary tools (e.g., browser
developer tools, custom software, local interception proxies) on their own
endpoints to tamper with messages and assemble new messages. Can send links to
honest users that are then visited by these users. This means that the web
attacker has the ability to cause arbitrary requests from users' browsers, as
long as the contents are known to the attacker.</t>
<t>Cannot intercept or block messages sent between other parties, and cannot break
cryptography unless the attacker has learned the respective decryption keys.
Deviating from the common web attacker model, A1 cannot play the role of a
legitimate AS in the ecosystem (see A1a).</t>
</section>

<section anchor="a1a-web-attacker-participating-as-as"><name>A1a - Web Attacker (participating as AS)</name>
<t>Like the web attacker A1, but can also participate as an AS in the ecosystem.
Note that this AS can reuse/replay messages it has received from honest ASs and
can send users to endpoints of honest ASs.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="a2-network-attacker"><name>A2 - Network attacker</name>
<t>Controls the whole network (like a rogue WiFi access point or any other
compromised network node). Can intercept, block, and tamper with messages
intended for other people, but cannot break cryptography unless the attacker has
learned the respective decryption keys.</t>
<t>Note: Most attacks that are exclusive to this kind of attacker can be defended
against by using transport layer protection like TLS.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="attackers-at-the-authorization-endpoint"><name>Attackers at the Authorization Endpoint</name>
<t><strong>Note:</strong> The attackers for the authorization request are more
fine-grained than those for the token endpoint and resource endpoint,
since these messages pass through the complex environment of the
user's browser/app/OS with a larger attack surface. This demands for a
more fine-grained analysis.</t>
<t><strong>Note:</strong> For the authorization endpoint, it is assumed that the attacker can
only passively read messages, whereas for the token and resource endpoints, it
is assumed that the attacker can also tamper with messages. Since messages to
and from the authorization endpoint are sent through the user's browser and the
attacker can redirect the user to arbitrary URLs anyway (see A1), the attacker
can already redirect the user to faked/spoofed authorization request and
response URLs. At the same time, while leakages from the authorization request
or response are very common in practice, a fully compromised connection to the
authorization endpoint is not. Most user authentication schemes would be broken
in this setting, undermining the security completely.</t>

<section anchor="a3a-read-authorization-request"><name>A3a - Read Authorization Request</name>
<t>The capabilities of the web attacker, but can also read the authorization
request sent in the front channel from a user's browser to the authorization
server. This might happen on mobile operating systems (where apps can register
for URLs), on all operating systems through the browser history, or due to
Cross-Site Scripting on the AS. There have been cases where anti-virus software
intercepts TLS connections and stores/analyzes URLs.</t>
<t>Note: An attacker that can read the authorization response is not
considered here, as, with current browser technology, such an attacker
can undermine most security protocols. This is discussed
in &quot;Browser Swapping Attacks&quot; in the Security Considerations in the FAPI
2.0 Security Profile.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="attackers-at-the-token-endpoint"><name>Attackers at the Token Endpoint</name>

<section anchor="a5-read-and-tamper-with-token-requests-and-responses"><name>A5 - Read and Tamper with Token Requests and Responses</name>
<t>This attacker makes the client use a token endpoint that is not the one of the
honest AS. This attacker can read and tamper with messages sent to and from this
token endpoint that the client thinks as of an honest AS.</t>
<t>Important: This attacker is a model for misconfigured token endpoint URLs that
were considered in FAPI 1.0. Since the FAPI 2.0 Security Profile mandates that
the token endpoint address is obtained from an authoritative source and via a
protected channel, i.e., through OAuth Metadata obtained from the honest AS,
this attacker is not relevant in FAPI 2.0. The description here is kept for
informative purposes only.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="attackers-at-the-resource-server"><name>Attackers at the Resource Server</name>

<section anchor="a7-read-resource-requests"><name>A7 - Read Resource Requests</name>
<t>The capabilities of the web attacker, but this attacker can also read requests
sent to the resource server after they have been processed by the resource server, for example because the attacker can read
TLS intercepting proxy logs on the RS's side.</t>
</section>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="limitations"><name>Limitations</name>
<t>Beyond the limitations already described in the introduction to the attacker
model above, it is important to note the following limitations:</t>

<section anchor="protocol-layers"><name>Protocol Layers</name>
<t>FAPI 2.0 profiles only define the behavior of API authorization and
authentication on certain protocol layers. As described above, attacks on lower
protocol layers (e.g., TLS) may break the security of FAPI 2.0 compliant systems
under certain conditions. The attacker model, however, takes some breaks in
the end-to-end security provided by TLS into account by already including the
respective attacker models (A3a/A5/A7). Similarly, many other attacks on
lower layers are already accounted for, for example:</t>

<ul>
<li><t>DNS spoofing attacks are covered by the network attacker (A2)</t>
</li>
<li><t>Leakages of authorization request data, e.g., through
misconfigured URLs or system/firewall logs, are covered by A3a</t>
</li>
<li><t>Directing users to malicious websites is within the capabilities of the web
attacker (A1)</t>
</li>
</ul>
<t>FAPI 2.0 aims to be secure when attackers exploit these attacks and all attacks
feasible to attackers described above, even in combination.</t>
<t>Other attacks are not covered by the attacker model. For example, user
credentials being exposed through misconfigured databases or remote code
execution attacks on authorization servers are neither prevented by nor
accounted for in the attacker model. As another example, when a user is using a
compromised browser and operating system, the security of the user is hard to
uphold. Phishing-resistant credentials, for example, may help in this case, but
are outside of the area defined by FAPI 2.0, as described next.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="secrets"><name>Secrets</name>
<t>The security assessment assumes that secrets are created such that attackers
cannot guess them - e.g., nonces and secret keys. Weak random number generators,
for example, may lead to secrets that are guessable by attackers and therefore
to vulnerabilities.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="system-boundaries"><name>System Boundaries</name>
<t>The FAPI 2.0 profiles focus on core aspects of the API security and do not
prescribe, for example, end-user authentication mechanisms, firewall setups,
software development practices, or security aspects of internal architectures.
Anything outside of boundaries of FAPI 2.0 must be assessed in the context of
the ecosystem, deployment, or implementation in which FAPI 2.0 is used.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="implementation-errors"><name>Implementation Errors</name>
<t>API security profiles can define how authentication and authorization is
supposed to be implemented and a formal model can assess whether the profiles
are secure and consistent with respect to ideal implementations. Real-world
implementations, of course, can deviate from the specified and formally analyzed
behavior and contain security vulnerabilties on various levels. While the FAPI
2.0 profiles are designed to provide multiple layers of defense where feasible,
implementations must use secure software development and deployment best
practices to ensure that vulnerabilities can be discovered and fixed.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="changes-over-time"><name>Changes over Time</name>
<t>New technologies or changed behavior of components (e.g., browsers) can lead to
new security vulnerabilities over time that might not have been known during the
development of these specifications.</t>
