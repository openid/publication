	Specifically, an authentication context class reference value
	is defined that requests that
	phishing-resistant authentication be performed
	and another is defined that requests that

	    <vspace/>
	    Phishing-Resistant.
	    An authentication mechanism where a party potentially under
	    the control of the Relying Party cannot gain sufficient
	    information to be able to successfully authenticate to the End
	    User's OpenID Provider as if that party were the End User. (Note
	    that the potentially malicious Relying Party controls where the
	    User-Agent is redirected to and thus may not send it to the End
	    User's actual OpenID Provider).
	    NOTE:  These semantics are the same as those specified in <xref target="OpenID.PAPE"/>.
	  </t>

	  <t hangText="phrh">
	    <vspace/>
	    Phishing-Resistant Hardware-Protected.
	    An authentication mechanism meeting the requirements for
	    phishing-resistant authentication above in which additionally
	    information needed to be able to successfully authenticate to the End
	    User's OpenID Provider as if that party were the End User
	    is held in a hardware-protected device or component.
	  </t>

	</list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
	Per commonly accepted security practices, it should be noted that
        the overall strength of any authentication is only as strong as its
        weakest step. It is thus recommended that provisioning of
        phishing-resistant and other credentials stronger than shared secrets
        should be accomplished using methods that are at least as strong as the
        credential being provisioned. By counter-example, allowing people to
        retrieve a phishing-resistant credential using only a phishable shared
        secret negates much of the value provided by the phishing-resistant
        credential itself.
        Similarly, sometimes using a phishing-resistant method when a
        phishable method continues to also sometimes be employed may still
        enable phishing attacks to compromise the authentication.
