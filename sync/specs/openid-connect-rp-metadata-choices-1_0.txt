      OpenID Connect Relying Party Metadata Choices 1.0 - draft 02
                 openid-connect-rp-metadata-choices-1_0

Abstract

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
   based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
   well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
   interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This specification extends the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client
   Registration 1.0 specification to enable RPs to express a set of
   supported values for some RP metadata parameters, rather than just
   single values.  This functionality is particularly useful when
   Automatic Registration, as defined in OpenID Federation 1.0, is used,
   since there is no registration response from the OP to tell the RP
   what choices were made by the OP.  This gives the OP the information
   that it needs to make choices about how to interact with the RP in
   ways that work for both parties.

1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749] protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the
   End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization
   Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-
   User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

   In order for an OpenID Connect Relying Party to utilize OpenID
   Connect services for an End-User, the RP needs to register with the
   OpenID Provider to provide the OP information about itself.  This
   specification extends the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration
   1.0 specification [OpenID.Registration] to enable RPs to express a
   set of supported values for some RP metadata parameters, rather than
   just single values.  This extension enables expression of multiple
   choices for parameters including supported algorithms and token
   endpoint authentication methods.  This functionality is particularly
   useful when Automatic Registration [OpenID.Federation] is used, since
   there is no registration response from the OP to tell the RP what
   choices were made by the OP.  This gives the OP the information that
   it needs to make choices about how to interact with the RP in ways
   that work for both parties.

   Single-valued metadata parameters for which corresponding multi-
   valued metadata parameters are defined by this specification are
   defined in these specifications:

   *  OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0
      [OpenID.Registration]

   *  OpenID Connect Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow -
      Core 1.0 [CIBA.Core]

   *  JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode for OAuth 2.0 (JARM)
      [JARM]

   *  JSON Web Token (JWT) Response for OAuth Token Introspection
      [RFC9701]

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174].

   All uses of JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS] and JSON Web Encryption
   (JWE) [JWE] data structures in this specification utilize the JWS
   Compact Serialization or the JWE Compact Serialization; the JWS JSON
   Serialization and the JWE JSON Serialization are not used.

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Authorization Server", "Client",
   "Client Authentication", "Client Identifier", and "Token Endpoint"
   defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], the term "JSON Web Token (JWT)"
   defined by JSON Web Token (JWT) [JWT], and the terms defined by
   OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core] and OpenID Connect Dynamic
   Client Registration 1.0 [OpenID.Registration].

2.  Client Metadata

   Clients have metadata associated with their unique Client Identifier
   at the Authorization Server.  These can range from human-facing
   display strings, such as a Client name, to items that impact the
   security of the protocol, such as the set of supported algorithms.

   The Client Metadata values are used in two ways:

   *  as input values to registration requests, and

   *  as output values in registration responses and read responses.

   Enabling the RP to express all the choices that it supports for
   metadata parameters is particularly important when using Automatic
   Registration, as defined in Section 12.1 of OpenID Federation 1.0
   [OpenID.Federation], since it gives the OP the best opportunity to
   make good choices of what parameters to use when interacting with the
   RP.  This specification is intended to faciliate such interactions.

   The Client Metadata parameters defined below MUST only be used as
   input values to registration requests, and not as output values in
   registration responses and read responses.  Any output values used
   related to these multi-valued input parameters MUST be the associated
   corresponding single-valued metadata parameter.

   These Client Metadata parameters are defined by this specification:

   subject_types_supported
      OPTIONAL.  JSON array containing a list of the subject_type values
      supported by the RP.  If a subject_type metadata parameter is also
      present, its value MUST be in the list.

   userinfo_encryption_enc_values_supported
      OPTIONAL.  JSON array containing a list of the JWE enc values
      supported by the RP when decrypting the UserInfo Response.  If a

      OPTIONAL.  JSON array containing a list of the JWS alg values
      supported by the Client when signing the JWT used to authenticate
      the Client at the Token Endpoint for the private_key_jwt and
      client_secret_jwt authentication methods.  If a
      token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg metadata parameter is also
      present, its value MUST be in the list.

   backchannel_authentication_request_signing_alg_values_supported
      OPTIONAL.  JSON array containing a list of the JWS alg values

   introspection_signing_alg_values_supported
      OPTIONAL.  JSON array containing a list of the JWS alg values
      supported by the Client when validating the Introspection Response
      signature.  If a introspection_signed_response_alg metadata
      parameter is also present, its value MUST be in the list.

   introspection_encryption_alg_values_supported
      OPTIONAL.  JSON array containing a list of the JWE alg values
      supported by the Client when decrypting the Introspection
      Response.  If a introspection_encrypted_response_alg metadata
      parameter is also present, its value MUST be in the list.

   introspection_encryption_enc_values_supported
      OPTIONAL.  JSON array containing a list of the JWE enc values
      supported by the Client when decrypting the Introspection
      Response.  If a introspection_encrypted_response_enc metadata
      parameter is also present, its value MUST be in the list.

   Additional Client Metadata parameters MAY be defined and used, as
   described in [RFC7591].

   Note that the naming convention used for these metadata parameters is
   to use the name of the corresponding Authorization Server Metadata
   parameter when it exists.  When it does not exist, the names chosen
   use the pattern *_values_supported, where * is the name of the
   corresponding single-valued Client Metadata parameter.

3.  Implementation Considerations

   To facilitate interoperability with implementations not supporting
   this specification, deployments SHOULD include the single-valued
   metadata parameter alongside the corresponding multi-valued metadata
   parameter with their preferred single value.

   Note that the Authorization Server might not support the single-
   valued parameter value.  For instance, consider these metadata
   values:

   "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": ["ES256", "PS256", "RS256"],
   "id_token_signed_response_alg": "RS256"

   Authorization Server SHOULD NOT consider it an error when it doesn't
   support RS256 if it supports either of the other choices ES256 or
   PS256.  It SHOULD use one of the choices that it does support, or
   reject the registration with the invalid_client_metadata error when
   none of the client-provided values are supported.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations when using these metadata parameters are
   the same as those when using the correspoding metadata parameters in
   [OpenID.Registration] and [OpenID.Discovery] or the other
   specifications in which they are defined.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  OAuth Dynamic Client Registration Metadata Registry

   This specification registers the following client metadata
   definitions in the IANA "OAuth Dynamic Client Registration Metadata"
   registry [IANA.OAuth.Parameters] established by [RFC7591].
