    <abstract>
      <t>OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
      protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based
      on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to
      obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and 
      REST-like manner.</t>

      <t>
	This specification augments OpenID Connect Core 1.0 by defining an additional 
	error code <spanx style="verb">unmet_authentication_requirements</spanx> to allow the 
	OpenID Provider to signal to the Relying Party it failed to authenticate 
	the End-User according to the requirements of the Relying Party.
