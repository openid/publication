   specification.

2.  UserInfo Endpoint

   The UserInfo Endpoint returns claims for the authenticated user.

   Claim objects contain members and member values which are the
   individual claims and claims values.  A claim object is represented
   by a JSON [RFC4627] object which contains a collection of name/value
   pairs for the claims.

2.1.  Requests

   Clients MAY send requests with the following parameters to the
   UserInfo Endpoint to obtain further information about the user.  The
   UserInfo Endpoint complies with the OAuth2 [OAuth2.0] Bearer Token
   [BEARER] specification.  As such, the access token SHOULD be
   specified via the HTTP Authorization header.

   access_token  REQUIRED.  The access_token obtained from an OpenID
      Connect authorization request.  This parameter MUST NOT be sent if
      the access token is sent in the HTTP Authorization header.

   schema  OPTIONAL.  The schema in which the data is to be returned.
      The only predefined value is "openid".  If this parameter is not
      included, the response may be a proprietary format to support
      backwards compatibility.  Custom scheme names and responses are
      out of scope for this specification.

   id RESERVED.  This is reserved for backwards compatibility.  It MUST
      be ignored by the endpoint if the "openid" schema is used.

2.2.  Responses

   If the requested schema is "openid", the response MUST return a plain
   text JSON object that contains a set of claims that are a subset of
   those defined below.  Additional claims (not specified below) MAY
   also be returned.

   The claims may be represented in multiple languages and scripts.  To
   specify the languages and scripts, BCP47 [RFC5646] language tags MUST
   be added to each claims delimited by a "#". e.g.,
   "familyName#ja-Kana-JP" for expressing Family Name in Katakana in
   Japanese, which is commonly used to index and represent the phonetics
   of the Kanji representation of the same represented as
   "familyName#ja-Hani-JP".

   | locale       | string  | The user's locale, represented as an RFC |
   |              |         | 5646 [RFC5646] language tag.  This is    |
   |              |         | typically an ISO 639-1 Alpha-2           |
   |              |         | [ISO639-1] language code in lowercase    |
   |              |         | and an ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 [ISO3166-1]    |
   |              |         | country code in uppercase, separated by  |
   |              |         | a dash.  For example, "en-US" or         |
   |              |         | "fr-CA".  As a compatibility note, some  |
   |              |         | implementations have used an underscore  |
   |              |         | as the separator rather than a dash, for |
   |              |         | example, "en_US"; Implementations MAY    |
   |              |         | choose to accept this locale syntax as   |
   |              |         | well.                                    |
   |              |         |                                          |
   | phone_number | string  | The user's preferred telephone number.   |
   |              |         | For example, "+1 (425) 555-1212" or "+56 |
   |              |         | (2) 687 2400".                           |
   |              |         |                                          |
   | address      | JSON    | The user's preferred address.  The value |
   |              | object  | of the "address" claim is a JSON         |
   |              |         | structure containing some or all of      |
   |              |         | these string-valued fields: "formatted", |
   |              |         | "street_address", "locality", "region",  |
   |              |         | "postal_code", and "country".  The       |
   |              |         | "street_address" field MAY contain       |
   |              |         | multiple lines if the address            |
   |              |         | representation requires it.              |
   |              |         | Implementations MAY return only a subset |
   |              |         | of the fields of an "address", depending |
   |              |         | upon the information available and the   |
   |              |         | user's privacy preferences.  For         |
   |              |         | example, the "country" and "region"      |
   |              |         | might be returned without returning more |
   |              |         | fine-grained address information.        |
   |              |         |                                          |
   | updated_time | string  | Time the user's information was last     |
   |              |         | updated, represented as a RFC 3339       |
   |              |         | [RFC3339] datetime.  For example,        |
   |              |         | "2011-01-03T23:58:42+0000".              |

                    Table 1: Reserved Claim Definitions

   For privacy reasons, OpenID providers may elect to not provide values
   for some schema elements as part of the "openid" scope.

   The UserInfo endpoint will return claims in JSON format unless a
   request for a different format is made by the RP in the Authorization

   request.  See the OpenID Connect Core [OpenID.CC] specification on
   how to request a different format.  The UserInfo Endpoint MUST return
   a content-type header to indicate which format is being returned.
   The following are accepted content types:

               | Content-Type     | Format Returned        |
               +------------------+------------------------+
               | application/json | plain text JSON object |
               +------------------+------------------------+
               | application/jwt  | A JWT                  |

Appendix B.  Document History

   [[ to be removed once the specification is approved ]]

   -03

   o  Added text describing the UserInfo endpoint as an OAuth2 protected
      resource complying with the OAuth2.0 Bearer Token specification.
      Also changed the response text to require the returned JSON object
      to comply with the specified schema if the schema parameter is
      "openid".  Changed SHOULD to MUST.  Added the OAuth2 Bearer Token
      specification to the list of referenced specifications and
      corrected the referenced URL in the OAuth2.0 target.

   -02

   o  Converted from Portable Contacts identifiers using camelCase to
      Facebook-style identifiers using
      lowercase_separated_by_underscores.  Also simplified a number of
      the fields that used to be structures or arrays so that they are
      now simple values.  Where the same names are used, they are
      intended to be compatible their usage as Facebook Graph API User
      [GraphAPI] fields.

   -01

   o  Minor changes to prepare for publication at openid.net/specs/.

   -00

   o  Initial draft incorporating consensus decisions reached at the
      Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) in May, 2011.  The schema
      specified is based upon Portable Contacts [POCO].
