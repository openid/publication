1.  Introduction

   This specification defines an extension to OpenID Connect [OpenID] to
   address the use case of strong identity verification of a natural
   person in accordance with certain laws.  Examples include Anti Money
   Laundering Laws, Telecommunication Acts, Anti Terror Laws, and
   regulations on trust services, such as eIDAS [eIDAS].

   In such use cases, the Relying Parties (RPs) need to know the
   assurance level of the Claims about the End-User attested by the
   OpenID Connect Providers (OPs) or any other trusted source along with
   evidence related to the identity verification process.

   The "acr" Claim, as defined in Section 2 of the OpenID Connect
   specification [OpenID], is suited to attest information about the
   authentication performed in a OpenID Connect transaction.  But
   identity assurance requires a different representation for the
   following reason: authentication is an aspect of an OpenID Connect
   transaction while identity assurance is a property of a certain Claim
   or a group of Claims and several of them will typically be conveyed
   to the RP as the result of an OpenID Connect transaction.

   For example, the assurance an OP typically will be able to attest for
   an e-mail address will be "self-asserted" or "verified by opt-in or
   similar mechanism".  The family name of a user, in contrast, might
   have been verified in accordance with the respective Anti Money
   Laundering Law by showing an ID Card to a trained employee of the OP
   operator.

   Identity assurance therefore requires a way to convey assurance data
   along with and coupled to the respective Claims about the End-User.
   This specification proposes a suitable representation and mechanisms
   the RP will utilize to request verified claims about an End-User

                 openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0     August 2019


   along with identity assurance data and for the OP to represent these
   verified Claims and accompanying identity assurance data.

1.1.  Terminology

   This section defines some terms relevant to the topic covered in this
   documents, heavily inspired by NIST SP 800-63A [NIST-SP-800-63a].

   o  Identity Proofing - process in which a user provides evidence to
      an OP or claim provider reliably identifying themselves, thereby
      allowing the OP to assert that identification at a useful identity
      assurance level.

   o  Identify Verification - process conducted by the OP or a claim
      provider to verify the user's identity.

   o  Identity Assurance - process in which the OP or a claim provider
      attests identity data of a certain user with a certain assurance
      towards a RP, typically expressed by way of an assurance level.
      Depending on legal requirements, the OP may also be required to
      provide evidence of the identity verification process to the RP.

   o  Verified Claims - Claims about an End-User, typically a natural
      person, whose binding to a particular user account were verified
      in the course of an identity verification process.

2.  Scope and Requirements

   The scope of the extension is to define a mechanism to assert
   verified Claims, in general, and to introduce new Claims about the
   End-User required in the identity assurance space; one example would
   be the place of birth.

   The RP will be able to request the minimal data set it needs (data
   minimization) and to express requirements regarding this data and the
   evidence and the identity verification processes employed by the OP.

   This extension will be usable by OPs operating under a certain
   regulation related to identity assurance, such as eIDAS notified eID
   systems, as well as other OPs.  Strictly regulated OPs can attest
   identity data without the need to provide further evidence since they
   are approved to operate according to well-defined rules with clearly
   defined liability.

   For example in the case of eIDAS, the peer review ensures eIDAS
   compliance and the respective member state takes the liability for
   the identities asserted by its notified eID systems.  Every other OP
   not operating under such well-defined conditions is typically



Lodderstedt & Fett      Expires February 16, 2020               [Page 3]

                 openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0     August 2019


   required to provide the RP data about the identity verification
   process along with identity evidence to allow the RP to conduct their
   own risk assessment and to map the data obtained from the OP to other
   laws.  For example, it shall be possible to use identity data
   maintained in accordance with the Anti Money Laundering Law to
   fulfill requirements defined by eIDAS.

   From a technical perspective, this means this specification allows
   the OP to attest verified Claims along with information about the
   respective trust framework (and assurance level) but also supports
   the externalization of information about the identity verification
   process.

   The representation defined in this specification can be used to
   provide RPs with verified Claims about the End-User via any
   appropriate channel.  In the context of OpenID Connnect, verified
   Claims can be attested in ID Tokens or as part of the UserInfo
   response.  It is also possible to utilize the format described here
   in OAuth Token Introspection responses (see [RFC7662] and
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-jwt-introspection-response]) to provide resource
   servers with verified Claims.

   This extension is intended to be truly international and support
   identity assurance for different and across jurisdictions.  The
   extension is therefore extensible to support additional trust
   frameworks, verification methods, and identity evidence.

   In order to give implementors as much flexibility as possible, this
   extension can be used in conjunction with existing OpenID Connect
   Claims and other extensions within the same OpenID Connect assertion
   (e.g., ID Token or UserInfo response) utilized to convey Claims about
   End-Users.

   For example, OpenID Connect [OpenID] defines Claims for representing
   family name and given name of a user without a verification status.
   Those Claims can be used in the same OpenID Connect assertion beside
   verified Claims represented according to this extension.

   In the same way, existing Claims to inform the RP of the verification
   status of the "phone_number" and "email" Claims can be used together
   with this extension.

   Even for asserting verified Claims, this extension utilizes existing
   OpenID Connect Claims if possible and reasonable.  The extension
   will, however, ensure RPs cannot (accidentally) interpret unverified
   Claims as verified Claims.

3.  Claims

3.1.  Additional Claims about End-Users

   In order to fulfill the requirements of some jurisdictions on
   identity assurance, this specification defines the following Claims
   for conveying user data in addition to the Claims defined in the
   OpenID Connect specification [OpenID]:

   o  "place_of_birth": a structured Claim representing the End-User's
      place of birth.  It consists of the following fields:

      *  "country": REQUIRED.  [ISO3166-1] Alpha-2 (e.g., DE) or
         [ISO3166-3]

      *  "region": State, province, prefecture, or region component.
         This field might be required in some jurisdictions.

      *  "locality": REQUIRED. city or other locality

   o  "nationalities": string array representing the user's
      nationalities in ICAO 2-letter codes [ICAO-Doc9303], e.g.  "US" or
      "DE". 3-letter codes MAY be used when there is no corresponding
      ISO 2-letter code, such as "EUE".

   o  "birth_family_name": family name someone has when he or she is
      born, or at least from the time he or she is a child.  This term
      can be used by a person who changes the family name later in life
      for any reason.

   o  "birth_given_name": given name someone has when he or she is born,
      or at least from the time he or she is a child.  This term can be
      used by a person who changes the given name later in life for any
      reason.

   o  "birth_middle_name": middle name someone has when he or she is
      born, or at least from the time he or she is a child.  This term
      can be used by a person who changes the middle name later in life
      for any reason.

   o  "salutation": End-User's salutation, e.g.  "Mr."

   o  "title": End-User's title, e.g.  "Dr."

                 openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0     August 2019


3.2.  txn Claim

   Strong identity verification typically requires the participants to
   keep an audit trail of the whole process.

   The "txn" Claim as defined in [RFC8417] is used in the context of
   this extension to build audit trails across the parties involved in
   an OpenID Connect transaction.

   If the OP issues a "txn", it MUST maintain a corresponding audit
   trail, which at least consists of the following details:

   o  the transaction id,

   o  the authentication methods employed, and

   o  the transaction type (e.g. scope values).

   This transaction data MUST be stored as long as it is required to
   store transaction data for auditing purposes by the respective
   regulation.

   The RP requests this Claim like any other Claim via the "claims"
   parameter or as part of a default Claim set identified by a scope
   value.

   The "txn" value MUST allow an RP to obtain these transaction details
   if needed.

   Note: the mechanism to obtain the transaction details from the OP and
   their format is out of scope of this specification.

4.  Verified Data Representation

   This extension to OpenID Connect wants to ensure that RPs cannot mix
   up verified and unverified Claims and incidentally process unverified
   Claims as verified Claims.

   The representation proposed therefore provides the RP with the
   verified Claims within a container element "verified_claims".  This
   container is composed of the verification evidence related to a
   certain verification process and the corresponding Claims about the
   End-User which were verified in this process.

   This section explains the structure and meaning of "verified_claims"
   in detail.  A machine-readable syntax definition is given as JSON
   schema in Section 12.  It can be used to automatically validate JSON
   documents containing a "verified_claims" element.

                 openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0     August 2019


   "verified_claims" consists of the following sub-elements:

   o  "verification": REQUIRED.  Object that contains all data about the
      verification process.

   o  "claims": REQUIRED.  Object that is the container for the verified
      Claims about the End-User.

   Note: implementations MUST ignore any sub-element not defined in this
   specification or extensions of this specification.

4.1.  verification Element

   This element contains the information about the process conducted to
   verify a person's identity and bind the respective person data to a
   user account.

   The "verification" element consists of the following elements:

   "trust_framework": REQUIRED.  String determing the trust framework
   governing the identity verification process and the identity
   assurance level of the OP.

   An example value is "eidas_ial_high", which denotes a notified eID
   system under eIDAS [eIDAS] providing identity assurance at level of
   assurance "High".

   An initial list of standardized values is defined in Trust Frameworks
   [1].  Additional trust framework identifiers can be introduced
   [how?].  RPs SHOULD ignore "verified_claims" claims containing a
   trust framework id they don't understand.

   The "trust_framework" value determines what further data is provided
   to the RP in the "verification" element.  A notified eID system under
   eIDAS, for example, would not need to provide any further data
   whereas an OP not governed by eIDAS would need to provide
   verification evidence in order to allow the RP to fulfill its legal
   obligations.  An example of the latter is an OP acting under the
   German Anti-Money laundering law ("de_aml").

   "time": Time stamp in ISO 8601:2004 [ISO8601-2004] "YYYY-MM-
   DDThh:mm:ss+/-hh" format representing the date and time when identity
   verification took place.  Presence of this element might be required
   for certain trust frameworks.

   "verification_process": Unique reference to the identity verification
   process as performed by the OP.  Used for backtracing in case of

                 openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0     August 2019


   disputes or audits.  Presence of this element might be required for
   certain trust frameworks.

   Note: While "verification_process" refers to the identity
   verification process at the OP, the "txn" claim refers to a
   particular OpenID Connect transaction in which the OP attested the
   user's verified identity data towards a RP.

   "evidence" is a JSON array containing information about the evidence
   the OP used to verify the user's identity as separate JSON objects.
   Every object contains the property "type" which determines the type
   of the evidence.  The RP uses this information to process the
   "evidence" property appropriately.

   Important: implementations MUST ignore any sub-element not defined in
   this specification or extensions of this specification.

4.1.1.  Evidence

   The following types of evidence are defined:

   o  "id_document": verification based on any kind of government issued
      identity document

   o  "utility_bill": verification based on a utility bill

   o  "qes": verification based on a eIDAS Qualified Electronic
      Signature

4.1.1.1.  id_document

   The following elements are contained in an "id_document" evidence
   sub-element.

   "method": REQUIRED.  The method used to verify the id document.
   Predefined values are given in Verification Methods [2]

   "verifier": OPTIONAL.  A JSON object denoting the legal entity that
   performed the identity verification on behalf of the OP.  This object
   SHOULD only be included if the OP did not perform the identity
   verification itself.  This object consists of the following
   properties:

   o  "organization": String denoting the organization which performed
      the verification on behalf of the OP.

                 openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0     August 2019


   o  "txn": identifier refering to the identity verification
      transaction.  This transaction identifier can be resolved into
      transaction details during an audit.

   "time": Time stamp in ISO 8601:2004 [ISO8601-2004] "YYYY-MM-
   DDThh:mm:ss+/-hh" format representing the date when this id document
   was verified.

   "document": A JSON object representing the id document used to
   perform the id verification.  It consists of the following
   properties:

   o  "type": REQUIRED.  String denoting the type of the id document.
      Standardized values are defined in Identity Documents [3].  The OP
      MAY use other than the predefined values in which case the RPs
      will either be unable to process the assertion, just store this
      value for audit purposes, or apply bespoken business logic to it.

   o  "number": String representing the number of the identity document.

   o  "issuer": A JSON object containg information about the issuer of
      this identity document.  This object consists of the following
      properties:

      *  "name": REQUIRED.  Designation of the issuer of the identity
         document

      *  "country": String denoting the country or organization that
         issued the document as ICAO 2-letter-code [ICAO-Doc9303], e.g.
         "JP".  ICAO 3-letter codes MAY be used when there is no
         corresponding ISO 2-letter code, such as "UNO".

   o  "date_of_issuance": REQUIRED if this attribute exists for the
      particular type of document.  The date the document was issued as
      ISO 8601:2004 YYYY-MM-DD format.

   o  "date_of_expiry": REQUIRED if this attribute exists for the
      particular type of document.  The date the document will expire as
      ISO 8601:2004 YYYY-MM-DD format.

4.1.1.2.  utility_bill

   The following elements are contained in a "utility_bill" evidence
   sub-element.

   "provider": REQUIRED.  A JSON object identifying the respective
   provider that issued the bill.  The object consists of the following
   properties:

                 openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0     August 2019


   o  "name": A String designating the provider.

   o  All elements of the OpenID Connect "address" Claim ([OpenID])

   "date": A ISO 8601:2004 YYYY-MM-DD formatted string containing the
   date when this bill was issued.

4.1.1.3.  qes

   The following elements are contained in a "qes" evidence sub-element.

   "issuer": REQUIRED.  A String denoting the certification authority
   that issued the signer's certificate.

   "serial_number": REQUIRED.  String containing the serial number of
   the certificate used to sign.

   "created_at": REQUIRED.  The time the signature was created as ISO
   8601:2004 YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+/-hh format.

4.2.  claims Element

   The "claims" element contains the claims about the End-User which
   were verified by the process and according to the policies determined
   by the corresponding "verification" element.

   The "claims" element MAY contain one or more of the following Claims
   as defined in Section 5.1 of the OpenID Connect specification
   [OpenID]

   o  "name"

   o  "given_name"

   o  "middle_name"

   o  "family_name"

   o  "birthdate"

   o  "address"

   or the claims defined in Section 3.1.

   The "claims" element MAY also contain other claims given the value of
   the respective claim was verified in the verification process
   represented by the sibling "verification" element.

                 openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0     August 2019


   Claim names MAY be annotated with language tags as specified in
   Section 5.2 of the OpenID Connect specification [OpenID].

5.  Requesting Verified Claims

5.1.  Requesting End-User Claims

   Verified Claims can be requested on the level of individual Claims
   about the End-User by utilizing the "claims" parameter as defined in
   Section 5.5. of the OpenID Connect specification [OpenID].

   "verified_claims" is added to the "userinfo" or "id_token" element of
   the "claims" parameter.

   Since "verified_claims" contains the effective Claims about the End-
   User in a nested "claims" element, the syntax is extended to include
   expressions on nested elements as follows.  The "verified_claims"
   element includes a "claims" element, which in turn includes the
   desired Claims as keys with a "null" value.  An example is shown in
   the following:

   {
      "userinfo":{
         "verified_claims":{
            "claims":{
               "given_name":null,
               "family_name":null,
               "birthdate":null
            }
         }
      }
   }

   Use of the "claims" parameter allows the RP to exactly select the
   Claims about the End-User needed for its use case.  This extension
   therefore allows RPs to fulfill the requirement for data
   minimization.

   RPs MAY indicate that a certain Claim is essential to the successful
   completion of the user journey by utilizing the "essential" field as
   defined in Section 5.5.1. of the OpenID Connect specification
   [OpenID].  The following example designates both given as well as
   family name as being essential.

         "verified_claims":{
            "claims":{
               "given_name":{"essential": true},
               "family_name":{"essential": true},
               "birthdate":null
            }
         }
      }
   }

   This specification introduces the additional field "purpose" to allow
   a RP to state the purpose for the transfer of a certain End-User
   Claim it is asking for.  The field "purpose" can be a member value of
   each individually requested Claim, but a Claim cannot have more than
   one associated purpose.

   "purpose" OPTIONAL.  String describing the purpose for obtaining a
   certain End-User Claim from the OP.  The purpose MUST NOT be shorter
   than 3 characters or longer than 300 characters.  If this rule is
   violated, the authentication request MUST fail and the OP returns an
   error "invalid_request" to the RP.  The OP MUST display this purpose
   in the respective user consent screen(s) in order to inform the user
   about the designated use of the data to be transferred or the
   authorization to be approved.  If the parameter "purpose" is not
   present in the request, the OP MAY display a value that was pre-
   configured for the respective RP.  For details on UI localization see
   Section 8.

   {
      "userinfo":{
         "verified_claims":{
            "claims":{
               "given_name":{
                  "essential":true,
                  "purpose":"To make communication look more personal"
               },
               "family_name":{
                  "essential":true
               },
               "birthdate":{
                  "purpose":"To send you best wishes on your birthday"
               }
            }
         }
      }
   }

   Note: A "claims" sub-element with value "null" is interpreted as a
   request for all possible Claims.  An example is shown in the
   following:

   {
      "userinfo":{
         "verified_claims":{
            "claims":null
         }
      }
   }

   Note: The "claims" sub-element can be omitted, which is equivalent to
   a "claims" element whose value is "null".

   Note: If the "claims" sub-element is empty or contains a Claim not
   fulfilling the requirements defined in Section 4.2, the OP will abort
   the transaction with an "invalid_request" error.

5.2.  Requesting Verification Data

   The content of the "verification" element is basically determined by
   the respective "trust_framework" and the Claim source's policy.

   This specification also defines a way for the RP to explicitly
   request certain data to be present in the "verification" element.
   The syntax is based on the rules given in Section 5.1 and extends
   them for navigation into the structure of the "verification" element.

   Elements within "verification" can be requested in the same way as
   defined in Section 5.1 by adding the respective element as shown in
   the following example:

   {
      "verified_claims":{
         "verification":{
            "date":null,
            "evidence":null
         },
         "claims":null
      }
   }

   It requests the date of the verification and the available evidence
   to be present in the issued assertion.

   Note: the RP does not need to explicitly request the
   "trust_framework" field as it is a mandatory element of the
   "verified_claims" Claim.

   The RP may also dig one step deeper into the structure and request
   certain data to be present within every "evidence".  A single entry
   is used as prototype for all entries in the result array:

   {
      "verified_claims":{
         "verification":{
            "date":null,
            "evidence":[
               {
                  "method":null,
                  "document":null
               }
            ]
         },
         "claims":null
      }
   }

   This example requests the "method" element and the "document" element
   for every evidence available for a certain user account.

   Note: the RP does not need to explicitly request the "type" field as
   it is a mandatory element of any "evidence" entry.

   The RP may also request certain data within the "document" element to
   be present.  This again follows the syntax rules used above.

   {
      "verified_claims":{
         "verification":{
            "date":null,
            "evidence":[
               {
                  "method":null,
                  "document":{
                     "issuer":null,
                     "number":null,
                     "date_of_issuance":null
                  }
               }
            ]
         },
         "claims":null
      }
   }

   Note: the RP does not need to explicitly request the "type" field as
   it is a mandatory element of any "document" entry.

   It is at the discretion of the Claim source to decide whether the
   requested verification data is provided to the RP.

5.3.  Defining constraints on Verification Data

   The RP MAY express requirements regarding the elements in the
   "verification" sub-element.

   This, again, requires an extension to the syntax as defined in
   Section 5.5. of the OpenID Connect specification [OpenID] due to the
   nested nature of the "verified_claims" claim.

   Section 5.5.1 of the OpenID Connect specification [OpenID] defines a
   query syntax that allows for the member value of the Claim being
   requested to be a JSON object with additional information/constraints
   on the Claim.  For doing so it defines three members ("essential",
   "value" and "values") with special query meanings and allows for
   other special members to be defined (while stating that any members
   that are not understood must be ignored).

   This specification re-uses that mechanism and introduces a new such
   member "max_age" (see below).

   To start with, the RP MAY limit the possible values of the elements
   "trust_framework", "evidence/type", "evidence/method", and
   "evidence/document/type" by utilizing the "value" or "values" fields.

   The following example shows that the RP wants to obtain an
   attestation based on AML and limited to users who were identified in
   a bank branch in person using government issued id documents.

   {
      "userinfo":{
         "verified_claims":{
            "verification":{
               "trust_framework":{
                  "value":"de_aml"
               },
               "evidence":[
                  {
                     "type":{
                        "value":"id_document"
                     },
                     "method":{
                        "value":"pipp"
                     },
                     "document":{
                        "type":{
                           "values":[
                              "idcard",
                              "passport"
                           ]
                        }
                     }
                  }
               ]
            },
            "claims":null
         }
      }
   }

   The RP MAY also express a requirement regarding the age of the
   verification data, i.e., the time elapsed since the verification
   process asserted in the "verification" element has taken place.

   This specification therefore defines a new member "max_age".

   "max_age": OPTIONAL.  Is a JSON number value only applicable to
   Claims that contain dates or timestamps.  It defines the maximum time
   (in seconds) to be allowed to elapse since the value of the date/
   timestamp up to the point in time of the request.  The OP should make
   the calculation of elapsed time starting from the last valid second
   of the date value.  The following is an example of a request for




Lodderstedt & Fett      Expires February 16, 2020              [Page 16]

                 openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0     August 2019


   Claims where the verification process of the data is not allowed to
   be older than 63113852 seconds.

   The following is an example:

   {
      "userinfo":{
         "verified_claims":{
            "verification":{
               "date":{
                  "max_age":63113852
               }
            },
            "claims":null
         }
      }
   }

   The OP SHOULD try to fulfill this requirement.  If the verification
   data of the user is older than the requested "max_age", the OP MAY
   attempt to refresh the user's verification by sending her through a
   online identity verification process, e.g. by utilizing an electronic
   ID card or a video identification approach.

   If the OP is unable to fulfill the requirement (even in case it is
   marked as being "essential"), it will provide the RP with the data
   available and the RP may decide how to use the data.  The OP MUST NOT
   return an error in case it cannot return all Claims requested as
   essential Claims.

6.  Examples

   The following sections show examples of "verified_claims".

   The first and second section show JSON snippets of the general
   identity assurance case, where the RP is provided with verification
   evidence for different verification methods along with the actual
   Claims about the End-User.

   The third section illustrates how the contents of this object could
   look like in case of a notified eID system under eIDAS, where the OP
   does not need to provide evidence of the identity verification
   process to the RP.

   Subsequent sections contain examples for using the "verified_claims"
   Claim on different channels and in combination with other
   (unverified) Claims.

6.5.  Verified Claims in ID Tokens

6.5.1.  Request

   In this case, the RP requests verified Claims along with other Claims
   about the End-User in the "claims" parameter and allocates the
   response to the ID Token (delivered from the token endpoint in case
   of grant type "code").

   The "claims" parameter value is

7.  OP Metadata

   The OP advertises its capabilities with respect to verified Claims in
   its openid-configuration (see [OpenID-Discovery]) using the following
   new elements:



Lodderstedt & Fett      Expires February 16, 2020              [Page 25]

                 openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0     August 2019


   "verified_claims_supported": Boolean value indicating support for
   "verified_claims", i.e. the OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance
   extension.

   "trust_frameworks_supported" This is a JSON array containing all
   supported trust frameworks.

   "evidence_supported" This JSON array contains all types of identity
   evidence the OP uses.

   "id_documents_supported" This JSON array contains all identity
   documents utilized by the OP for identity verification.

   "id_documents_verification_methods_supported" This element is a JSON
   array containing the id document verification methods a OP supports
   as defined in Section 4.1.

   "claims_in_verified_claims_supported" This JSON array contains all
   claims supported within "verified_claims".

   This is an example openid-configuration snippet:

      "trust_frameworks_supported":[
        "nist_800_63A_ial_2",
        "nist_800_63A_ial_3"
      ],
      "evidence_supported":[

         "place_of_birth",
         "nationality",
         "address"
      ],
   ...
   }

   The OP MUST support the "claims" parameter and needs to publish this
   in its openid-configuration using the "claims_parameter_supported"
   element.

8.  Transaction-specific Purpose

   This specification introduces the request parameter "purpose" to
   allow a RP to state the purpose for the transfer of user data it is
   asking for.

   "purpose" OPTIONAL.  String describing the purpose for obtaining
   certain user data from the OP.  The purpose MUST NOT be shorter than
   3 characters and MUST NOT be longer than 300 characters.  If these
   rules are violated, the authentication request MUST fail and the OP
   returns an error "invalid_request" to the RP.

                 openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0     August 2019


   The OP MUST display this purpose in the respective user consent
   screen(s) in order to inform the user about the designated use of the
   data to be transferred or the authorization to be approved.

   In order to ensure a consistent UX, the RP MAY send the "purpose" in
   a certain language and request the OP to use the same language using
   the "ui_locales" parameter.

   If the parameter "purpose" is not present in the request, the OP MAY
   utilize a description that was pre-configured for the respective RP.

   Note: In order to prevent injection attacks, the OP MUST escape the
   text appropriately before it will be shown in a user interface.  The
   OP MUST expect special characters in the URL decoded purpose text
   provided by the RP.  The OP MUST ensure that any special characters
   in the purpose text cannot be used to inject code into the web
   interface of the OP (e.g., cross-site scripting, defacing).  Proper
   escaping MUST be applied by the OP.  The OP SHALL NOT remove
   characters from the purpose text to this end.

9.  Privacy Consideration

   OP and RP MUST establish a legal basis before exchanging any
   personally identifiable information.  It can be established upfront
   or in the course of the OpenID process.

10.  Security Considerations

   The integrity and authenticity of the issued assertions MUST be
   ensured in order to prevent identity spoofing.  The Claims source
   MUST therefore cryptographically sign all assertions.

   The confidentiality of all user data exchanged between the protocol
   parties MUST be ensured using suitable methods at transport or
   application layer.
