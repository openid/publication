Abstract

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
   based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
   well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
   interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This specification enables OpenID Connect Relying Parties to request
   that specific authentication context classes be applied to
   authentications performed and for OpenID Providers to inform Relying
   Parties whether these requests were satisfied.  Specifically, an
   authentication context class reference value is defined that requests
   that phishing-resistant authentication be performed and another is
   defined that requests that phishing-resistant authentication with a
   hardware-protected key be performed.  These policies can be
   satisfied, for instance, by using W3C scoped credentials or FIDO
   authenticators.

1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749] protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the
   End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization
   Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-
   User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This specification enables OpenID Connect [OpenID.Core] Relying
   Parties to request that specific authentication context classes be
   applied to authentications performed and for OpenID Providers to
   inform Relying Parties whether these requests were satisfied.
   Specifically, an authentication context class reference value is
   defined that requests that phishing-resistant authentication be
   performed and another is defined that requests that phishing-
   resistant authentication with a hardware-protected key be performed.
   These policies can be satisfied, for instance, by using W3C scoped
   credentials [W3C.WebAuthn] or FIDO authenticators [FIDO.CTAP].

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174].

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms defined by OpenID Connect Core 1.0
   [OpenID.Core].

2.  Authentication Context Class Reference Values

   The acr (Authentication Context Class Reference) claim and associated
   acr_values request parameter are defined by the OpenID Connect Core
   1.0 specification [OpenID.Core].  The following Authentication
   Context Class Reference values are defined by this specification:

   phr
      Phishing-Resistant.  An authentication mechanism where a party
      potentially under the control of the Relying Party cannot gain
      sufficient information to be able to successfully authenticate to
      the End User's OpenID Provider as if that party were the End User.
      (Note that the potentially malicious Relying Party controls where
      the User-Agent is redirected to and thus may not send it to the
      End User's actual OpenID Provider).  NOTE: These semantics are the
      same as those specified in [OpenID.PAPE].

   phrh
      Phishing-Resistant Hardware-Protected.  An authentication
      mechanism meeting the requirements for phishing-resistant
      authentication above in which additionally information needed to
      be able to successfully authenticate to the End User's OpenID
      Provider as if that party were the End User is held in a hardware-
      protected device or component.

3.  Authentication Method Reference Value

   The IANA "Authentication Method Reference Values" registry [IANA.AMR]
   established by [RFC8176] contains Authentication Method Reference
   values to use in the amr (Authentication Methods References) claim
   [OpenID.Core].  The following Authentication Method Reference value
   is defined by this specification:

   pop
      Proof-of-possession of a key.  Unlike the existing hwk and swk
      methods, it is unspecified whether the proof-of-possession key is
      hardware-secured or software-secured.

4.  Security Considerations

   Per commonly accepted security practices, it should be noted that the
   overall strength of any authentication is only as strong as its
   weakest step.  It is thus recommended that provisioning of phishing-
   resistant and other credentials stronger than shared secrets should
   be accomplished using methods that are at least as strong as the
   credential being provisioned.  By counter-example, allowing people to
   retrieve a phishing-resistant credential using only a phishable
   shared secret negates much of the value provided by the phishing-
   resistant credential itself.  Similarly, sometimes using a phishing-
   resistant method when a phishable method continues to also sometimes
   be employed may still enable phishing attacks to compromise the
   authentication.

   The downgrade attack described in Section 10.5 of [RFC9101] can be
   prevented by using signed requests, as defined in Section 6 of
   [OpenID.Core] and [RFC9101].  In particular, using signed requests
   prevents modification or removal of the acr_values request parameter.

   It is the responsibility of the Relying Party to validate that the
   value of any acr (Authentication Context Class Reference) claim
   received meets its requirements, including that an acr claim is
   provided, when required.  In particular, if the RP's request included
   an acr_values request parameter, it should verify that any acr value
   received is in the set requested or that it is otherwise compatible
   with its authentication requirements.
