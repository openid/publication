                             iGov Use Cases                  August 2023


1.  USG-NIST Note

   Should we separate authentication from claims here?  Each use case
   discussion assertions of identity data, then userinfo for claims.
   Should we exclude claims from authentication requests?  In addition,
   phase 1 of the iGov work will not be to support exotic privacy
   requirements, but shouldn't we have use cases for them?  Typically
   identity claims in idToken and attributes in userinfo endpoint.  Many
   optimize with attributes coming back in IDToken.  Fix indirect to be
   proxy/hub.  Broker is more of a biz model then a technology.

2.  Types of eID Scheme

   The eID schemes used for access to government systems varies
   considerably between nations and can be crudely categorised by the
   origin of eID issuance (e.g. public or private sector), and the model
   of eID federation (direct or indirect model, for example, a broker or
   hub).  Overlaid are the legal requirements for eID largely derived
   from more general law such as Data Protection / Privacy regulations
   and acts under national and / or international law.  There are some
   specific eID laws although the most widespread currently is the eIDAS
   Regulation applying to all 28 EU Member States.  These variances
   should be reflected in the flexibility of the iGov profile in order
   to support the widest possible range of government eID solutions.

3.  Federation Models to be Considered for iGov Profile


3.1.  Direct RP / IDP Relationship

   In this model the RP and IDP(s) are known to each other directly and
   the user is able to select and IDP (where multiple choices are
   available) directly when interacting with the RP service.  This is
   often the case where there are a small number of national eID IDPs
   and those providers are relatively static.

   This model assumes that the Relying Party and the Identity Provider
   have a direct relationship and do not require a broker or federation
   hub to route authentication requests.

3.2.  Indirect Model

   There are a variety of examples nationally where an identity broker
   or federation hub has been deployed, such as the UK, Sweden and
   Denmark as well the US (Connect.Gov).  It is clear that this model
   will persist and that other nations are considering the
   implementation of similar models.

   In this case a Broker or Federation Hub is used to route requests for
   authentication from Relying Parties to the required Identity
   Provider.  The method used to choose an identity provider is
   implementation specific and can be user and/or Relying Party driven.

3.3.  Direct Relationship - Dynamic Discovery

   This is primarily a gov-to-gov use case, promoting federated identity
   to promote home agency credential reuse at other agencies.

   In the USG, the PIV card was intended to be usable at all agencies.
   For example, a NIST employee could use her card at GSA for both
   logical and physical access, all based on interoperable PKI.  This
   has not really materialized, and USG is discovering that other non-
   PIV, non-PKI credentials have utility for a broad range of users that
   will never get a PIV.  This use case promote the original intent of
   HSPD-12 and PIV - issue once, use everywhere.

4.  Claims Requirements (UserInfo)

   In the interests of data minimisation balanced with the requirement
   to successfully identify the individual signing in to a service,
   claims have been split into mandatory and optional user info
   (identity) claims.  It is expected that these claims would be made
   available via a UserInfo endpoint.

4.4.  The Need to Support Identity Matching

   Matching of the identity assertion based on claims to a local
   identifier or 'account' related to the individual identity at a level
   of assurance is a requirement where the government in question is not
   able to provide a single identifier for all citizens based on an
   authoritative register of citizens.

   The requirement for matching is also of importance where a cross-
   border or cross-jurisdiction authentication is required and therefore
   the availability of a single identifier (e.g. social security number)
   cannot be guaranteed for the individual wishing to authenticate.

   In general, matching an asserted set of claims for an identity to
   relying party held records for know individuals requires a minimum
   set of data elements to be provided.  Research in the UK and across
   the EU under the eIDAS Regulation has identified the minimum set of
   citizen attributes required to affect a successful match.  Due to
   regional and national law this set of attribute may vary although the
   key elements are: name, date of birth, current address (including
   postal code), gender (were consent given).

5.  Levels of Assurance

   Identity Providers must include an Authentication Context describing
   the level of assurance achieved for the asserted identity.  These
   values will be described as URIs in the same format as the SAML
   Authentication Context Class Reference construct.

   It is recommended that both FICAM and eIDAS URI's are supported in
   the authentication context by default.

                | http://eidas.europa.eu/LoA/high        |
                +----------------------------------------+

                    Table 9: eIDAS Levels of Assurance

   There is no requirement for authentication methods to be described in
   the Authentication Context as standards for levels of assurance
   should be outcome based.  This also removes the requirement for RPs
   and IDPs to have a shared understanding of the authentication method
   values.

   Technical considerations for the messaging flow to protect the
   consuming services and individual users from attack.

     |                 | interception and replay of claims.         |
     |                 | Consider the use of a digital signature    |
     |                 | mechanism to sign messages as well as      |
     |                 | setting a validity period for the message. |
