           OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0 - draft 00

Abstract

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
   based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
   well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
   interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This specification defines a mechanism for a Relying Party to request
   that an OpenID Provider log out the End-User.

                 OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0        July 2020


1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749] protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the
   End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization
   Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-
   User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This specification complements the OpenID Connect Core 1.0
   [OpenID.Core] specification by enabling the Relying Party to request
   that an End-User be logged out by the OpenID Provider.

   This specification can be used separately from or in combination with
   OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 [OpenID.Session], OpenID
   Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0 [OpenID.FrontChannel], and/or OpenID
   Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0 [OpenID.BackChannel].

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   In the .txt version of this document, values are quoted to indicate
   that they are to be taken literally.  When using these values in
   protocol messages, the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.
   In the HTML version of this document, values to be taken literally
   are indicated by the use of "this fixed-width font".

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Authorization Endpoint",
   "Authorization Server", "Client", and "Client Identifier" defined by
   OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], the term "User Agent" defined by RFC 7230
   [RFC7230], and the terms defined by OpenID Connect Core 1.0
   [OpenID.Core].

   IMPORTANT NOTE TO READERS: The terminology definitions in this
   section are a normative portion of this specification, imposing
   requirements upon implementations.  All the capitalized words in the
   text of this specification, such as "Relying Party", reference these
   defined terms.  Whenever the reader encounters them, their
   definitions found in this section must be followed.

2.  RP-Initiated Logout

   An RP can notify the OP that the End-User has logged out of the site
   and might want to log out of the OP as well.  In this case, the RP,
   after having logged the End-User out of the RP, redirects the End-
   User's User Agent to the OP's logout endpoint URL.  This URL is
   normally obtained via the "end_session_endpoint" element of the OP's
   Discovery response or may be learned via other mechanisms.

   This specification also defines the following parameters that are
   passed as query parameters in the logout request:

   id_token_hint
      RECOMMENDED.  Previously issued ID Token passed to the logout
      endpoint as a hint about the End-User's current authenticated
      session with the Client.  This is used as an indication of the
      identity of the End-User that the RP is requesting be logged out
      by the OP.  The OP need not be listed as an audience of the ID
      Token when it is used as an "id_token_hint" value.

   post_logout_redirect_uri
      OPTIONAL.  URL to which the RP is requesting that the End-User's
      User Agent be redirected after a logout has been performed.  The
      value MUST have been previously registered with the OP, either
      using the "post_logout_redirect_uris" Registration parameter or
      via another mechanism.  If supplied, the OP SHOULD honor this
      request following the logout.

   state
      OPTIONAL.  Opaque value used by the RP to maintain state between
      the logout request and the callback to the endpoint specified by
      the "post_logout_redirect_uri" query parameter.  If included in
      the logout request, the OP passes this value back to the RP using
      the "state" query parameter when redirecting the User Agent back
      to the RP.

   At the logout endpoint, the OP SHOULD ask the End-User whether he
   wants to log out of the OP as well.  If the End-User says "yes", then
   the OP MUST log out the End-User.

   As part of the OP logging out the End-User, the OP uses the logout
   mechanism(s) registered by the RPs to notify any RPs logged in as
   that End-User that they are to likewise log out the End-User.  RPs
   can use any of OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0
   [OpenID.Session], OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0
   [OpenID.FrontChannel], and/or OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0
   [OpenID.BackChannel] to receive logout notifications from the OP,
   depending upon which of these mechanisms the OP and RPs mutually

                 OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0        July 2020


   support.  The RP initiating the logout is to be included in these
   notifications before the post-logout redirection defined in Section 3
   is performed.

2.1.  OpenID Provider Discovery Metadata

   To support OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout, the RP needs to obtain
   the RP-Initiated Logout related OP metadata.  This OP metadata is
   normally obtained via the OP's Discovery response, as described in
   OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 [OpenID.Discovery], or MAY be learned
   via other mechanisms.

   This OpenID Provider Metadata parameter MUST be included in the
   Server's discovery responses when RP-Initiated Logout and Discovery
   are supported:

   end_session_endpoint
      REQUIRED.  URL at the OP to which an RP can perform a redirect to
      request that the End-User be logged out at the OP.

                 OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0        July 2020


3.  Redirection to RP After Logout

   In some cases, the RP will request that the End-User's User Agent to
   be redirected back to the RP after a logout has been performed.
   Post-logout redirection is only done when the logout is RP-initiated,
   in which case the redirection target is the
   "post_logout_redirect_uri" query parameter value used by the
   initiating RP; otherwise it is not done.  This specification defines
   this Dynamic Registration parameter for this purpose, per Section 2.1
   of OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0
   [OpenID.Registration].

3.1.  Client Registration Metadata

   This Client Metadata parameter MAY be included in the Client's
   Registration information when RP-Initiated Logout and Dynamic
   Registration are supported:

   post_logout_redirect_uris
      OPTIONAL.  Array of URLs supplied by the RP to which it MAY
      request that the End-User's User Agent be redirected using the
      "post_logout_redirect_uri" parameter after a logout has been
      performed.

4.  Validation

   If any of the validation procedures defined in this specification
   fail, any operations requiring the information that failed to
   correctly validate MUST be aborted and the information that failed to
   validate MUST NOT be used.

5.  Implementation Considerations

   This specification defines features used by both Relying Parties and
   OpenID Providers that choose to implement RP-Initiated Logout.  All
   of these Relying Parties and OpenID Providers MUST implement the
   features that are listed in this specification as being "REQUIRED" or
   are described with a "MUST".  No other implementation considerations
   for implementations of RP-Initiated Logout are defined by this
   specification.

                 OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0        July 2020


6.  Security Considerations

   The "id_token_hint" parameter to a logout request can be used to
   determine which RP initiated the logout request.  Logout requests
   without a valid "id_token_hint" value are a potential means of denial
   of service; therefore, OPs may want to require explicit user
   confirmation before acting upon them.
