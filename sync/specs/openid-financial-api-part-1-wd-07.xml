    <note title="Introduction">
      <t>Fintech is an area of future economic growth around the world and Fintech organizations need to improve the security of their operations and protect customer data. It is common practice of aggregation services to use screen scraping as a method to capture data by storing users' passwords. This brittle, inefficient, and insecure practice creates security vulnerabilities which require financial institutions to allow what appears to be an automated attack against their applications and to maintain a whitelist of aggregators. A new draft standard, proposed by this workgroup would instead utilize an API model with structured data and a token model, such as OAuth [RFC6749, RFC6750].</t>
      <t>The Financial-grade API aims to provide specific implementation guidelines for online financial services to adopt by developing a REST/JSON data model protected by a highly secured OAuth profile. The Financial-grade API security profile can be applied to online services in any market area that requires a higher level of security than provided by standard OAuth or OpenID Connect.</t>
      <t>This document is Part 1 of FAPI that specifies the Financial-grade API and it provides a profile of OAuth that is suitable to be used in the access of read-only financial data and similar use cases.</t>
      <t>A higher level of security profile is provided in Part 2, suitable for read and write financial access APIs and other similar situations where the risk is higher.</t>
      <t>Although it is possible to code an OpenID Provider and Relying Party from first principles using this specification, the main audience for this specification is parties who already have a certified implementation of OpenID Connect and want to achieve a higher level of security. Implementers are encouraged to understand the security considerations contained in section 7.6 before embarking on a 'from scratch' implementation.</t>

Since the access token can be used against multiple URIs, the risk of leaking is much larger than the refresh token, which is used only against the token endpoint. Thus, the lifetime of the access token should be much shorter than that of the refresh token. Refer to section 16.18 of [OIDC] for more discussion on the lifetimes of access tokens and refresh tokens.  </t></section></section><section title="Native Apps" anchor="native-apps" toc="default"><t>When native apps are used as either public clients, dynamically registered confidential clients or user-agents receiving the authorization response for a server based confidential client, the recommendations for OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps in [BCP212] shall be followed, with the following additional requirements: </t><t>When registering redirect URIs, authorization servers </t><t><list style="numbers"><t>shall not support "Private-Use URI Scheme Redirection"; </t><t>shall not support "Loopback Interface Redirection"; </t></list></t><t>These requirements mean that FAPI compliant implementations can only support native apps through the use of "Claimed https Scheme URI Redirection".  </t><t>Note: nothing in this document seeks to disallow fixed urls in the form https://localhost:port-number/callback, as these are particularly useful in non-production systems or in clients used in development, to facilitate faster and easier development.  </t></section><section title="Incomplete or incorrect implementations of the specifications" anchor="incomplete-or-incorrect-implementations-of-the-specifications" toc="default"><t>To achieve the full security benefits, it is important the implementation of this specification, and the underlying OpenID Connect and OAuth specifications, are both complete and correct.  </t><t>The OpenID Foundation provides tools that can be used to confirm that an implementation is correct: </t><t>https://openid.net/certification/ </t><t>The OpenID Foundation maintains a list of certified implementations: </t><t>https://openid.net/developers/certified/ </t><t>Deployments that use this specification should use a certified implementation.  </t></section><section title="Discovery &amp; Multiple Brands" anchor="discovery-multiple-brands" toc="default"><t>Organisations who need to support multiple "brands" with individual authorization endpoints from a single Authorization Server deployment shall use a separate <spanx style="verb" xml:space="preserve">issuer</spanx> per brand.
