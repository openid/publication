    <abstract>
      <t>OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
      protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based
      on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to
      obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and 
      REST-like manner.</t>

      <t>
	This OpenID Connect Implicit Client Implementer's Guide 1.0 contains a subset of the
	OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification
	that is designed to be easy to read and implement for basic
	Web-based Relying Parties using the
	OAuth 2.0 Implicit Flow.
	This specification intentionally duplicates content from the Core
	specification to provide a self-contained implementer's guide for basic
	Web-based Relying Parties using the
	OAuth Implicit Flow.
      </t>
      <t>
	OpenID Providers and non-Web-based applications
	should instead consult the Core specification.

      <t>
	This OpenID Connect Implicit Client Implementer's Guide 1.0 contains a subset of the
	<xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</xref> specification
	that is designed to be easy to read and implement for basic
	Web-based Relying Parties using the
	OAuth <xref target="RFC6749"/> Implicit Flow.
	This specification intentionally duplicates content from the Core
	specification to provide a self-contained implementer's guide for basic
	Web-based Relying Parties using the
	OAuth Implicit Flow.
	Should there be any conflicts between the contents of this implementer's guide
	and the OpenID Connect Core specification, the latter takes precedence.
      </t>
      <t>
	See the
	<xref target="OpenID.Basic">OpenID Connect Basic Client Implementer's Guide 1.0</xref>
	for a related guide for basic
	Web-based Relying Parties using the
	OAuth <spanx style="verb">authorization_code</spanx> grant type.
	OpenID Providers and non-Web-based applications
	should instead consult the Core specification.
	This guide omits implementation and security
	considerations for OpenID Providers and non-Web-based applications.
      </t>

      <t>
	As background,
	the <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework</xref>
	and <xref target="RFC6750">OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage</xref>
	specifications provide a general framework for third-party applications
	to obtain and use limited access to HTTP resources.  They define
	mechanisms to obtain and use Access Tokens to access resources but
	do not define standard methods to provide identity information.
	Notably, without profiling OAuth 2.0, it is incapable of
	providing information about the authentication of an End-User.
	Readers are expected to be familiar with these specifications.
      </t>
      <t>
	OpenID Connect implements authentication as an extension to the
	OAuth 2.0 authorization process.
	Use of this extension is requested by Clients by including
	the <spanx style="verb">openid</spanx> scope value
	in the Authorization Request.
	An Authorization Request using these extensions
	is called an Authentication Request.
      </t>
      <t>
	Information about the authentication performed is returned
	in a <xref target="JWT">JSON Web Token (JWT)</xref>
	called an ID Token (see <xref target="IDToken"/>).
	OAuth 2.0 Authentication Servers implementing OpenID Connect
	are also referred to as OpenID Providers (OPs).
	OAuth 2.0 Clients using OpenID Connect
	are also referred to as Relying Parties (RPs).
      </t>
      <t>
	This specification assumes that the Relying Party has already obtained
	configuration information about the OpenID Provider, including its
	Authorization Endpoint location.
	This information is normally obtained via Discovery,
	as described in <xref target="OpenID.Discovery">OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0</xref>,
	or may be obtained via other mechanisms.
      </t>
      <t>
	Likewise, this specification assumes that the Relying Party has already obtained
	sufficient credentials and provided information needed to use the OpenID Provider.
	This is normally done via Dynamic Registration,
	as described in
	<xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0</xref>,
	or may be obtained via other mechanisms.
      </t>

	Authentication Requests can follow one of three paths:
	the Authorization Code Flow,
	the Implicit Flow, or
	the Hybrid Flow.
	The Authorization Code Flow is
	intended for Clients that can securely maintain a Client Secret between
	themselves and the Authorization Server, whereas the Implicit Flow is
	intended for Clients that cannot.
	However, the Authorization Code flow is sometimes also used by Native applications
	and other Clients in order to be able to obtain a Refresh Token,
	even when they cannot ensure the secrecy of the Client Secret value.
	The Hybrid Flow combines aspects of the Authorization Code Flow
	and the Implicit Flow.
	It enables Clients to obtain an ID Token optionally an Access Token with only
	one round trip to the Authorization Server, possibly minimizing latency,
	while still enabling Clients to later get tokens from the Token Endpoint
	-- especially a Refresh Token.
      </t>

      <t>
	This specification only provides information that is sufficient for
	basic Clients using the Implicit Flow.
      </t>

      <section anchor="ImplicitFlow" title="Implicit Flow">

            <t>Authorization Server authenticates the End-User.</t>

            <t>Authorization Server obtains End-User Consent/Authorization.</t>

            <t>Authorization Server sends the End-User back to the Client with
            an ID Token and, if requested, an Access Token.</t>

	    <t>Client validates the tokens and retrieves the End-User's
	    Subject Identifier.</t>

	    When the RP wishes to Authenticate the End-User

	    <list style="numbers">

	      <t>
		The Issuer Identifier for the OpenID Provider
		(which is typically obtained during Discovery)
		MUST exactly match the value of the

		the Client as a valid audience, or if it contains additional audiences not trusted by the Client.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		If the ID Token contains multiple audiences, the Client SHOULD verify
		that an <spanx style="verb">azp</spanx> Claim is present.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		If an <spanx style="verb">azp</spanx> (authorized party) Claim is present,
		the Client SHOULD verify that its <spanx style="verb">client_id</spanx>
		is the Claim Value.
	      </t>

	      <t>
		The Client MUST validate the signature of the ID Token according to
		<xref target="JWS">JWS</xref> using the algorithm specified in the 
		<spanx style="verb">alg</spanx> parameter of the JWT header.
		The Client MUST use the keys provided by the Issuer.

		The current time MUST be before the time represented by the

		(possibly allowing for some small leeway to account for clock skew).
	      </t>

	      <t>The <spanx style="verb">iat</spanx> Claim can be used to reject tokens that

	      for replay attacks.
	      The precise method for detecting replay attacks is Client specific.</t>
	      
	      <t>If the <spanx style="verb">acr</spanx> Claim was requested, the

	      <t>
		When a <spanx style="verb">max_age</spanx> request is made,

	<section anchor="ClaimsLanguagesAndScripts" title="Claims Languages and Scripts">
	  <t>
	    Human-readable Claim Values and Claim Values that reference human-readable values
	    MAY be represented in multiple languages and scripts.
	    To specify the languages and scripts, <xref
	    target="RFC5646">BCP47</xref> language tags are added to member names,
	    delimited by a <spanx style="verb">#</spanx> character.  For example,
	    <spanx style="verb">family_name#ja-Kana-JP</spanx> expresses the
	    Family Name in Katakana in Japanese, which is commonly used to index
	    and represent the phonetics of the Kanji representation of the same
	    represented as <spanx style="verb">family_name#ja-Hani-JP</spanx>.
	    As another example, both <spanx style="verb">website</spanx> and
	    <spanx style="verb">website#de</spanx> Claim Values might be returned,
	    referencing a Web site in an unspecified language and a Web site
	    in German.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Since Claim Names are case sensitive, it is strongly RECOMMENDED
	    that language tag values used in Claim Names be spelled using the
	    character case with which they are registered in the
	    <xref target="IANA.Language">IANA Language Subtag Registry</xref>.
	    In particular, normally language names are spelled with lowercase characters,
	    region names are spelled with uppercase characters, and
	    scripts are spelled with mixed case characters.
	    However, since BCP47 language tag values are case insensitive,
	    implementations SHOULD interpret the language tag values supplied
	    in a case insensitive manner.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Per the recommendations in BCP47, language tag values for Claims
	    SHOULD only be as specific as necessary.
	    For instance, using <spanx style="verb">fr</spanx> might be sufficient
	    in many contexts, rather than <spanx style="verb">fr-CA</spanx> or
	    <spanx style="verb">fr-FR</spanx>.
	    Where possible, OPs SHOULD try to match requested Claim locales with
	    Claims it has.  For instance, if the Client asks for a Claim with
	    a <spanx style="verb">de</spanx> (German) language tag and the OP
	    has a value tagged with <spanx style="verb">de-CH</spanx> (Swiss German)
	    and no generic German value, it would be appropriate for the OP
	    to return the Swiss German value to the Client.
	    (This intentionally moves as much of the complexity of language tag
	    matching to the OP as possible, to simplify Clients.)
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    A <spanx style="verb">claims_locales</spanx> request can be used to
	    specify the preferred languages and scripts to use for the returned Claims.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    When the OP determines, either through the
	    <spanx style="verb">claims_locales</spanx> parameter,
	    or by other means, that the End-User and Client are
	    requesting Claims in only one set of languages and scripts,
	    it is RECOMMENDED that OPs return Claims without language tags
	    when they employ this language and script.
	    It is also RECOMMENDED that Clients be written in a manner
	    that they can handle and utilize Claims using language tags.
	  </t>

	<section anchor="ClaimStability" title="Claim Stability and Uniqueness">

	  <t>
	    The <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> (subject) and
	    <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> (issuer) Claims, used together,
	    are the only Claims that an RP
	    can rely upon as a stable identifier for the End-User,
	    since the <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx>
	    Claim MUST be locally unique and never reassigned within the Issuer
	    for a particular End-User, as described in <xref target="IDToken"></xref>.
	    Therefore, the only guaranteed unique identifier for a given End-User is the
	    combination of the <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> Claim
	    and the <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> Claim.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    All other Claims carry no such guarantees across different issuers in terms of
	    stability over time or uniqueness across users, and Issuers are permitted to
	    apply local restrictions and policies. For instance, an Issuer MAY re-use an
	    <spanx style="verb">email</spanx> Claim Value across different
	    End-Users at different points in time, and the claimed 
	    <spanx style="verb">email</spanx> address for a given End-User MAY change 
	    over time.
	    Therefore, other Claims such as <spanx style="verb">email</spanx>,
	    <spanx style="verb">phone_number</spanx>, and
	    <spanx style="verb">preferred_username</spanx>
	    and MUST NOT be used as unique identifiers for the End-User.

	Processing some OpenID Connect messages requires comparing
	values in the messages to known values. For example, the Claim
	Names returned by the UserInfo Endpoint might be compared to
	specific Claim Names such as <spanx
	style="verb">sub</spanx>.  Comparing Unicode strings,
	however, has significant security implications.
      </t>
      <t>
	Therefore, comparisons between JSON strings and other Unicode
	strings MUST be performed as specified below:

	<list style="numbers">
          <t>
	    Remove any JSON applied escaping to produce an array of
	    Unicode code points.
	  </t>
          <t>
	    Unicode Normalization <xref target="USA15"/> MUST NOT
	    be applied at any point to either the JSON string or to
	    the string it is to be compared against.
	  </t>
          <t>
	    Comparisons between the two strings MUST be performed as a
	    Unicode code point to code point equality comparison.
	  </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
	In several places, this specification uses space delimited
	lists of strings.  In all such cases, the ASCII space
	character (0x20) MUST be the only character used for this purpose.

	Whenever Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used by this specification,

	vulnerabilities. At the time of this writing, TLS version 1.2 <xref target='RFC5246' />
	is the most recent version, but has a very limited deployment base and might not be
	readily available for implementation. TLS version 1.0 <xref target='RFC2246' /> is the

	    It replaces the parameters {userinfo,id_token,request_object,token_endpoint}_algs_supported
	    with {userinfo,id_token,request_object,token_endpoint}_signing_alg_values_supported
	    and {userinfo,id_token,request_object,token_endpoint}_encryption_{alg,enc}_values_supported.
