           OpenID Connect Basic Client Profile 1.0 - draft 25

Abstract

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   protocol.  It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
   based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
   well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
   interoperable and REST-like manner.

   OpenID Connect Basic Client Profile 1.0 is a profile of the OpenID
   Connect Messages 1.0 and OpenID Connect Standard 1.0 specifications
   that is designed to be easy to read and implement for basic Web-based
   Relying Parties using the OAuth "authorization_code" grant type.
   This specification intentionally duplicates content from the Messages
   and Standard specifications to provide a self-contained
   implementation profile for basic Web-based Relying Parties using the
   OAuth "authorization_code" grant type.

   OpenID Providers and non-Web-based applications should instead
   consult the Messages and Standard specifications.

1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect Basic Client Profile 1.0 is a profile of the OpenID
   Connect Messages 1.0 [OpenID.Messages] and OpenID Connect Standard
   1.0 [OpenID.Standard] specifications that is designed to be easy to
   read and implement for basic Web-based Relying Parties using the
   OAuth "authorization_code" grant type.  This specification
   intentionally duplicates content from the Messages and Standard
   specifications to provide a self-contained implementation profile for
   basic Web-based Relying Parties using the OAuth "authorization_code"
   grant type.

   See the OpenID Connect Implicit Client Profile 1.0 [OpenID.Implicit]
   specification for a related profile for basic Web-based Relying
   Parties using the OAuth implicit grant type.  OpenID Providers and
   non-Web-based applications should instead consult the Messages and
   Standard specifications.  This profile omits implementation and
   security considerations for OpenID Providers and non-Web-based
   applications.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are
   to be taken literally.  When using these values in protocol messages,
   the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.

   When the RFC 2119 language applies to the behavior of OpenID
   Providers, it is in this specification for explanatory value to help
   Client implementers understand the expected behavior of OpenID
   Providers.

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Refresh Token",
   "Authorization Code", "Authorization Grant", "Authorization Server",
   "Authorization Endpoint", "Client", "Client Identifier", "Client
   Secret", "Protected Resource", "Resource Owner", "Resource Server",
   and "Token Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].

   This specification also defines the following terms:

2.  Protocol Elements

   Authorization Requests can follow one of two paths; the Implicit Flow
   or the Authorization Code Flow.  The Authorization Code Flow is
   suitable for Clients that can securely maintain a Client Secret
   between themselves and the Authorization Server whereas, the Implicit
   Flow is suitable for Clients that cannot.

   This specification only provides information that is sufficient for
   basic Clients using the Code Flow.

2.1.  Code Flow

   The Code Flow consists of the following steps:

   1.  Client prepares an Authorization Request containing the desired
       request parameters.

   2.  Client sends a request to the Authorization Server.

   3.  Authorization Server authenticates the End-User.

   4.  Authorization Server obtains the End-User Consent/Authorization.

   5.  Authorization Server sends the End-User back to the Client with
       "code".

   6.  Client sends the "code" to the Token Endpoint to receive an
       Access Token and ID Token in the response.

2.1.1.  Client Prepares Authorization Request

   When the Client wishes to access a Protected Resource and the End-
   User Authorization has not yet been obtained, the Client prepares an
   Authorization Request to the Authorization Endpoint.

   Communication with the Authorization Endpoint MUST utilize TLS.  See
   Section 7.1 for more information on using TLS.

   Clients MAY construct the request using the HTTP "GET" or the HTTP
   "POST" method as defined in RFC 2616 [RFC2616].

   If using the HTTP "GET" method, the parameters are serialized using
   the Query String Serialization, per Section 3.1.  If using the HTTP
   "POST" method, the request parameters are added to the HTTP request
   entity-body using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format as
   defined by [W3C.REC-html401-19991224].

   The following is a non-normative example of an Authorization Request
   URL (with line wraps for display purposes only):

     https://server.example.com/authorize?
       response_type=code
       &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
       &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
       &scope=openid%20profile
       &state=af0ifjsldkj

2.1.1.1.  Request Parameters

   This profile of OpenID Connect uses the following OAuth 2.0 request
   parameters:

   response_type  REQUIRED.  This value MUST be "code".  This requests
      that both an Access Token and an ID Token be returned from the
      Token Endpoint in exchange to "code".

   client_id  REQUIRED.  OAuth 2.0 Client Identifier.

   scope  REQUIRED.  Space delimited, case sensitive list of ASCII OAuth
      2.0 scope values.  OpenID Connect requests MUST contain the
      "openid" scope value.  OPTIONAL scope values of "profile",
      "email", "address", "phone", and "offline_access" are also
      defined.  See Section 2.4 for more about the scope values defined
      by this specification.

   redirect_uri  REQUIRED.  Redirection URI to which the response will
      be sent.  This MUST be pre-registered with the OpenID Provider.
      If the Client only uses the OAuth "authorization_code" grant type,
      the redirection URI MAY use the "http" scheme, provided that the
      Client Type is "confidential", as defined in Section 2.1 of OAuth
      2.0.

   state  RECOMMENDED.  Opaque value used to maintain state between the
      request and the callback; serves as a protection against XSRF
      attacks.

   This specification also defines the following request parameters:

   nonce  OPTIONAL.  String value used to associate a Client session
      with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks.  The value is
      passed through unmodified from the Authorization Request to the ID
      Token.  Use of the nonce is OPTIONAL when using the code flow.

                 OpenID Connect Basic Client Profile 1.0      March 2013


   display  OPTIONAL.  ASCII string value that specifies how the
      Authorization Server displays the authentication and consent user
      interface pages to the End-User.  The defined values are:

      page  The Authorization Server SHOULD display authentication and
         consent UI consistent with a full User-Agent page view.  If the
         display parameter is not specified this is the default display
         mode.

      popup  The Authorization Server SHOULD display authentication and
         consent UI consistent with a popup User-Agent window.  The
         popup User-Agent window SHOULD be 450 pixels wide and 500
         pixels tall.

      touch  The Authorization Server SHOULD display authentication and
         consent UI consistent with a device that leverages a touch
         interface.  The Authorization Server MAY attempt to detect the
         touch device and further customize the interface.

      wap  The Authorization Server SHOULD display authentication and
         consent UI consistent with a "feature phone" type display.

   prompt  OPTIONAL.  Space delimited, case sensitive list of ASCII
      string values that specifies whether the Authorization Server
      prompts the End-User for reauthentication and consent.  The
      defined values are:

      none  The Authorization Server MUST NOT display any authentication
         or consent user interface pages.  An error is returned if the
         End-User is not already authenticated or the Client does not
         have pre-configured consent for the requested Claims.  This can
         be used as a method to check for existing authentication and/or
         consent.

      login  The Authorization Server MUST prompt the End-User for
         reauthentication.

      consent  The Authorization Server MUST prompt the End-User for
         consent before returning information to the Client.

      select_account  The Authorization Server MUST prompt the End-User
         to select a user account.  This allows a user who has multiple
         accounts at the Authorization Server to select amongst the
         multiple accounts that they may have current sessions for.

      The "prompt" parameter can be used by the Client to make sure that
      the End-User is still present for the current session or to bring
      attention to the request.  If this parameter contains "none" with

                 OpenID Connect Basic Client Profile 1.0      March 2013


      any other value, an error is returned.

   max_age  OPTIONAL.  Maximum Authentication Age. Specifies that the
      End-User must be actively authenticated if the End-User was
      authenticated longer ago than the specified number of seconds.
      When "max_age" is used, the ID Token returned MUST include an
      "auth_time" Claim Value.

   ui_locales  OPTIONAL.  End-User's preferred languages and scripts for
      the user interface, represented as a space-separated list of BCP47
      [RFC5646] language tag values, ordered by preference.  For
      instance, the value "fr-CA fr en" represents a preference for
      French as spoken in Canada, then French (without a region
      designation), followed by English (without a region designation).
      An error SHOULD NOT result if some or all of the requested locales
      are not supported by the OpenID Provider.

   claims_locales  OPTIONAL.  End-User's preferred languages and scripts
      for Claims being returned, represented as a space-separated list
      of BCP47 [RFC5646] language tag values, ordered by preference.  An
      error SHOULD NOT result if some or all of the requested locales
      are not supported by the OpenID Provider.

   id_token_hint  OPTIONAL.  Previously issued ID Token passed to the
      Authorization Server as a hint about the End-User's current or
      past authenticated session with the Client.  This SHOULD be
      present when "prompt=none" is used.  If the End-User identified by
      the ID Token is logged in or is logged in by the request, then the
      Authorization Server returns a positive response; otherwise, it
      SHOULD return a negative response.

   login_hint  OPTIONAL.  Hint to the Authorization Server about the
      login identifier the End-User may use to log in (if necessary).
      This hint can be used by an RP if it first asks the End-User for
      their e-mail address (or other identifier) and then wants to pass
      that value as a hint to the discovered authorization service.  It
      is RECOMMENDED that the hint value match the value used for
      discovery.  This value MAY also be a phone number in the format
      specified for the "phone_number" Claim.  The use of this parameter
      is left to the OP's discretion.

   acr_values  OPTIONAL.  Requested Authentication Context Class
      Reference values.  Space-separated string that specifies the "acr"
      values that the Authorization Server MUST use for processing
      requests from this Client.  The Authentication Context Class
      satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the "acr"
      Claim Value, as specified in Section 2.2.

2.1.2.  Client Sends Request to Authorization Server

   Having constructed the Authorization Request, the Client sends it to
   the Authorization Endpoint using HTTPS.

   Following is a non-normative example using HTTP redirect (with line
   wraps for display purposes only):

     HTTP/1.1 302 Found
     Location: https://server.example.com/authorize?
       response_type=code
       &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
       &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
       &scope=openid%20profile
       &state=af0ifjsldkj

2.1.3.  Authorization Server Authenticates End-User

   The Authorization Server authenticates the resource owner to make
   sure that consent is obtained from the right party.  If interaction
   with the End-User occurs over an HTTP channel, it MUST use TLS, as
   per Section 7.1.  The exact authentication methods used are out of
   scope for this specification.

2.1.4.  Authorization Server Obtains End-User Consent/Authorization

   The Authorization Server obtains an authorization decision for the
   requested Claims.  This can done by presenting the End-User with a
   dialogue that allows the End-User to recognize what he is consenting
   to and obtain his consent or by establishing consent via other means
   (for example, via previous administrative consent).

   The "openid" scope value declares that this OAuth 2.0 request is an
   OpenID Connect request.  Use of all other scope values is OPTIONAL.

2.1.5.  Authorization Server Sends End-User Back to Client

   Once the authorization is determined, the Authorization Server
   returns a successful response or an error response.

2.1.5.1.  End-User Grants Authorization

   If the Resource Owner grants the access request, the Authorization
   Server issues a "code" and delivers it to the Client by adding the
   following query parameters to the query component of the redirection
   URI using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format as defined
   in Section 4.1.2 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].

                 OpenID Connect Basic Client Profile 1.0      March 2013


   code  REQUIRED.  OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code.

   state  OAuth 2.0 state value.  REQUIRED if the "state" parameter is
      present in the Client Authorization Request.  Clients MUST verify
      that the "state" value is equal to the exact value of "state"
      parameter in the Authorization Request.

   The following is a non-normative example (with line wraps for the
   display purposes only):

2.1.5.2.  End-User Denies Authorization or Invalid Request

   If the End-User denies the authorization or the End-User
   authentication fails, the Authorization Server MUST return the error
   Authorization Response as defined in 4.1.2.1 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].
   No other parameters SHOULD be returned.

2.1.6.  Client Obtains ID Token and Access Token

   The Client then makes an Access Token Request using the Authorization
   Code to obtain tokens from the Token Endpoint in the following
   manner:

2.1.6.1.  Client Sends Code

   The Client makes a request to the Token Endpoint using the Form
   Serialization, per Section 3.2, as described in Section 4.1.3 of
   OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].  The Client authenticates itself by
   communicating its form-urlencoded Client Credentials in an
   Authorization header using the HTTP Basic method, as described in
   2.3.1 of OAuth 2.0.  (This method is the one identified by using the
   "client_secret_basic" authentication method value in OpenID Connect
   Discovery 1.0 [OpenID.Discovery]).

   Communication with the Token Endpoint MUST utilize TLS.  See
   Section 7.1 for more information on using TLS.

       &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb

2.1.6.2.  Client Receives Tokens

   The Client receives a response with the following parameters as
   described in Section 4.1.4 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].  The response
   should be encoded using UTF-8.

   access_token  REQUIRED.  Access Token for the UserInfo Endpoint.

   token_type  REQUIRED.  OAuth 2.0 Token Type value.  The value MUST be
      "Bearer" or another "token_type" value that the Client has
      negotiated with the Authorization Server.  Clients implementing
      this profile MUST support the OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage
      [RFC6750] specification.  This profile only describes the use of
      bearer tokens.

   id_token  REQUIRED.  ID Token.

   expires_in  OPTIONAL.  Expiration time of the Access Token in seconds
      since the response was generated.

   refresh_token  OPTIONAL.  Refresh Token.

   The Client can then use the Access Token to access protected
   resources at Resource Servers.

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: application/json
     Cache-Control: no-store
     Pragma: no-cache
     {

      "expires_in":3600,
      "refresh_token":"tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA",
      "id_token":"eyJ0 ... NiJ9.eyJ1c ... I6IjIifX0.DeWt4Qu ... ZXso"
     }

2.2.  ID Token

   The ID Token is a security token that contains Claims about the
   authentication event and other requested Claims.  The ID Token is
   represented as a JSON Web Token (JWT) [JWT].

   The ID Token is used to manage the authentication event and user
   identifier and is scoped to a particular Client via the "aud"
   (audience) Claim.

   The following Claims are used within the ID Token:

   iss  REQUIRED.  Issuer Identifier for the Issuer of the response.

   sub  REQUIRED.  Subject identifier.  A locally unique and never
      reassigned identifier within the Issuer for the End-User, which is
      intended to be consumed by the Client. e.g. "24400320" or
      "AItOawmwtWwcT0k51BayewNvutrJUqsvl6qs7A4".  It MUST NOT exceed 255
      ASCII characters in length.

   aud  REQUIRED.  Audience that this ID Token is intended for.  It MUST
      contain the OAuth 2.0 "client_id" of the Client.

   azp  OPTIONAL.  Authorized Presenter.  This member identifies an
      OAuth 2.0 Client authorized to use this ID Token as an OAuth
      Access Token.  It MUST contain the "client_id" of the Authorized
      Presenter.  This Claim is only needed when the party requesting
      the ID Token is not the same as the audience of the ID Token.

   exp  REQUIRED.  Expiration time on or after which the ID Token MUST
      NOT be accepted for processing.  The processing of this parameter
      requires that the current date/time MUST be before the expiration
      date/time listed in the value.  Implementers MAY provide for some

      small leeway, usually no more than a few minutes, to account for
      clock skew.  The value is the number of seconds from 1970-01-
      01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the desired date/time.  See RFC
      3339 [RFC3339] for details regarding date/times in general and UTC
      in particular.

   iat  REQUIRED.  Time at which the JWT was issued.  The value is the
      number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until
      the desired date/time.  See RFC 3339 [RFC3339] for details
      regarding date/times in general and UTC in particular.

   auth_time  OPTIONAL or REQUIRED.  Time when the End-User
      authentication occurred, specified as the number of seconds since
      1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC.  When a "max_age" request is
      made then this Claim is REQUIRED.

   acr  OPTIONAL.  Authentication Context Class Reference.  String
      specifying an Authentication Context Class Reference value that
      identifies the Authentication Context Class that the
      authentication performed satisfied.  The value "0" indicates the
      End-User authentication did not meet the requirements of ISO/IEC
      29115 [ISO29115] level 1.  Authentication using a long-lived
      browser cookie, for instance, is one example where the use of
      "level 0" is appropriate.  Authentications with level 0 should
      never be used to authorize access to any resource of any monetary
      value.  An absolute URI or a registered name [RFC6711] MAY be used
      as an "acr" value.

   amr  OPTIONAL.  Authentication Methods References.  JSON array of
      strings that are identifiers for authentication methods used in
      the authentication.  For instance, values might indicate that both
      password and OTP authentication methods were used.  The definition
      of particular values to be used in the "amr" Claim is beyond the
      scope of this specification.

   The JWT MAY contain other Claims.  Any Claims used that are not
   understood MUST be ignored.

   The following is a non-normative example of a base64url decoded ID
   Token (with line wraps for display purposes only):

     {
      "iss": "https://server.example.com",
      "sub": "24400320",
      "aud": "s6BhdRkqt3",
      "exp": 1311281970,
      "iat": 1311280970
     }

2.2.1.  ID Token Validation

   If any of the validation procedures defined in this specification
   fail, any operations requiring the information that failed to
   correctly validate MUST be aborted and the information that failed to
   validate MUST NOT be used.

   The Client MUST validate the ID Token in the Token Response.  To do
   this, the Client can split the "id_token" at the period (".")
   characters, take the second segment, and base64url decode it to
   obtain a JSON object containing the ID Token Claims, which MUST be
   validated as follows:

   1.  The Client MUST validate that the "iss" (issuer) Claim is valid
       for the Token Endpoint that the "id_token" was received from.

   2.  The Client MUST validate that the "aud" (audience) Claim contains
       its "client_id" value registered at the Issuer identified by the
       "iss" (issuer) Claim as an audience.  The ID Token MUST be
       rejected if the ID Token does not list the Client as a valid
       audience, or if it contains additional audiences not trusted by
       the Client.

   3.  The current time MUST be less than the value of the "exp" Claim
       (possibly allowing for some small leeway to account for clock
       skew).

   4.  The "iat" Claim can be used to reject tokens that were issued too
       far away from the current time, limiting the amount of time that
       nonces must be stored to prevent attacks.  The acceptable range
       is Client specific.

   5.  If the "acr" Claim was requested, the Client SHOULD check that
       the asserted Claim Value is appropriate.  The meaning and
       processing of "acr" Claim Values is out of scope for this
       specification.

   6.  When a "max_age" request is made, the Client SHOULD check the
       "auth_time" Claim value and request re-authentication if it
       determines too much time has elapsed since the last End-User
       authentication.

2.3.  UserInfo Endpoint

   The UserInfo Endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource that returns
   Claims about the authenticated End-User.  The location of the
   UserInfo Endpoint MUST be a URL using the "https" scheme, which MAY
   contain port, path, and query parameter components.  The returned

                 OpenID Connect Basic Client Profile 1.0      March 2013


   Claims are represented by a JSON object that contains a collection of
   name and value pairs for the Claims.

   Communication with the UserInfo Endpoint MUST utilize TLS.  See
   Section 7.1 for more information on using TLS.

2.3.1.  UserInfo Request

   Clients send requests to the UserInfo Endpoint to obtain Claims about
   the End-User.  The UserInfo Endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749]
   Protected Resource that complies with the OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token
   Usage [RFC6750] specification.  The Access Token SHOULD be sent using
   the "Authorization" header field.  The following parameters are
   defined for use in UserInfo Requests:

   access_token  REQUIRED.  Access Token obtained from an OpenID Connect
      Authorization Request.  This parameter MUST only be sent using one
      method using either the "Authorization" header field or a form-
      encoded "POST" body parameter.

   The following is a non-normative example of a UserInfo Request:

     GET /userinfo HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Authorization: Bearer SlAV32hkKG

2.3.2.  UserInfo Response

   The UserInfo Claims MUST be returned as the members of a JSON object.
   The response body SHOULD be encoded using UTF-8.  The Claims defined
   in Section 2.5 can be returned, as can additional Claims not
   specified there.

   If a Claim is not returned, that Claim Name SHOULD be omitted from
   the JSON object representing the Claims; it SHOULD NOT be present
   with a null or empty string value.

   The "sub" (subject) Claim MUST always be returned in the UserInfo
   Response.

   NOTE: The UserInfo Endpoint response is not guaranteed to be about
   the End-User identified by the "sub" (subject) element of the ID
   Token.  The "sub" Claim in the UserInfo Endpoint response MUST be
   verified to exactly match the "sub" Claim in the ID Token before
   using additional UserInfo Endpoint Claims.

                 OpenID Connect Basic Client Profile 1.0      March 2013


2.3.3.  UserInfo Error Response

   When an error condition occurs, the UserInfo Endpoint returns an
   Error Response as defined in Section 3 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token
   Usage [RFC6750].

2.4.  Scope Values

   OpenID Connect Clients use "scope" values as defined in 3.3 of OAuth
   2.0 [RFC6749] to specify what access privileges are being requested
   for Access Tokens.  The scopes associated with Access Tokens
   determine what resources will be available when they are used to
   access OAuth 2.0 protected endpoints.  For OpenID Connect, scopes can
   be used to request that specific sets of information be made
   available as Claim Values.  OAuth 2.0 allows additional scope values
   to be specified, as extensions.  This specification describes only
   the scope values used by OpenID Connect.

   Claims requested by the following scopes are treated by Authorization
   Servers as Voluntary Claims.

   OpenID Connect defines the following "scope" values:

   openid  REQUIRED.  Informs the Authorization Server that the Client
      is making an OpenID Connect request.  If the "openid" scope value
      is not present, the behavior is entirely unspecified.

   profile  OPTIONAL.  This scope value requests access to the End-
      User's default profile Claims, which are: "name", "family_name",
      "given_name", "middle_name", "nickname", "preferred_username",
      "profile", "picture", "website", "gender", "birthdate",
      "zoneinfo", "locale", and "updated_time".

   email  OPTIONAL.  This scope value requests access to the "email" and
      "email_verified" Claims.

   address  OPTIONAL.  This scope value requests access to the "address"
      Claim.

   phone  OPTIONAL.  This scope value requests access to the
      "phone_number" and "phone_number_verified" Claims.

   offline_access  OPTIONAL.  This scope value requests that an OAuth
      2.0 Refresh Token be issued that can be used to obtain an Access
      Token that grants access to the End-User's UserInfo Endpoint even
      when the user is not present (not logged in).

   Multiple scope values MAY be used by creating a space delimited, case

   sensitive list of ASCII scope values.

   The Claims requested by the "profile", "email", "address", and
   "phone" scope values are returned from the UserInfo Endpoint, as
   described in Section 2.3.2.

   In some cases, the End-User will be given the option to have the
   OpenID Provider decline to provide some or all information requested
   by Clients.  To minimize the amount of information that the user is
   being asked to disclose, a Client may elect to only request a subset
   of the information available from the UserInfo Endpoint.

   The following is a non-normative example of a "scope" Request.

     scope=openid profile email phone

2.5.  Standard Claims

   This profile defines a set of standard Claims.  They are returned in
   the UserInfo Response.

2.5.1.  Address Claim

   The components of a physical mailing address.  Implementations MAY
   return only a subset of the fields of an "address", depending upon
   the information available and the End-User's privacy preferences.
   For example, the "country" and "region" might be returned without
   returning more fine-grained address information.

   Implementations MAY return just the full address as a single string
   in the formatted sub-field, or they MAY return just the individual
   component fields using the other sub-fields, or they MAY return both.
   If both variants are returned, they SHOULD be describing the same
   address, with the formatted address indicating how the component
   fields SHOULD be combined.

   formatted  Full mailing address, formatted for display or use on a
      mailing label.  This field MAY contain multiple lines, separated
      by newline characters.  This is the primary member of this Claim
      value, for the purposes of sorting and filtering.

   street_address  Full street address component, which may include
      house number, street name, Post Office Box, and multi-line
      extended street address information.  This field MAY contain
      multiple lines, separated by newline characters.

   locality  City or locality component.

   region  State, province, prefecture or region component.

   postal_code  Zip code or postal code component.

   country  Country name component.

2.5.2.  Claims Languages and Scripts

   Human-readable Claim Values and Claim Values that reference human-
   readable values MAY be represented in multiple languages and scripts.
   To specify the languages and scripts, BCP47 [RFC5646] language tags
   are added to member names, delimited by a "#" character.  For
   example, "family_name#ja-Kana-JP" expresses the Family Name in
   Katakana in Japanese, which is commonly used to index and represent
   the phonetics of the Kanji representation of the same represented as
   "family_name#ja-Hani-JP".  As another example, both "website" and
   "website#de" Claim Values might be returned, referencing a Web site
   in an unspecified language and a Web site in German.

   Since Claim Names are case sensitive, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that
   language tag values used in Claim Names be spelled using the
   character case with which they are registered in the IANA Language
   Subtag Registry [IANA.Language].  In particular, normally language
   names are spelled with lowercase characters, region names are spelled
   with uppercase characters, and languages are spelled with mixed case
   characters.  However, since BCP47 language tag values are case
   insensitive, implementations SHOULD interpret the language tag values
   supplied in a case insensitive manner.

   Per the recommendations in BCP47, language tag values for Claims
   should only be as specific as necessary.  For instance, using "fr"
   might be sufficient in many contexts, rather than "fr-CA" or "fr-FR".
   Where possible, OPs should try to match requested Claim locales with
   Claims it has.  For instance, if the Client asks for a Claim with a
   "de" (German) language tag and the OP has a value tagged with "de-CH"
   (Swiss German) and no generic German value, it would be appropriate
   for the OP to return the Swiss German value to the Client.  (This
   intentionally moves as much of the complexity of language tag
   matching to the OP as possible, to simplify Clients.)

   A "claims_locales" request can be used to specify the preferred



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 25]

                 OpenID Connect Basic Client Profile 1.0      March 2013


   languages and scripts to use for the returned Claims.

   When the OP determines, either through the "claims_locales"
   parameter, or by other means, that the End-User and Client are
   requesting Claims in only one set of languages and scripts, it is
   RECOMMENDED that OPs return Claims without language tags when they
   employ this language and script.  It is also RECOMMENDED that Clients
   be written in a manner that they can handle and utilize Claims using
   language tags.

2.5.3.  Claim Stability and Uniqueness

   The "sub" (subject) and "iss" (issuer) Claims are the only Claims
   that a Client can rely upon as a stable identifier for the End-User,
   since the "sub" Claim MUST be locally unique and never reassigned
   within the Issuer for a particular End-User, as described in
   Section 2.2.  Therefore, the only guaranteed unique identifier for a
   given End-User is the combination of the "iss" Claim and the "sub"
   Claim.

   All other Claims carry no such guarantees across different issuers in
   terms of stability over time or uniqueness across users, and Issuers
   are permitted to apply local restrictions and policies.  For
   instance, an Issuer MAY re-use an "email" Claim value across
   different End-Users at different points in time, and the claimed
   "email" address for a given End-User MAY change over time.
   Therefore, other Claims such as "email", "phone_number", and
   "preferred_username" and MUST NOT be used as unique identifiers for
   the End-User.

3.  Serializations

   A request message MAY be serialized using one of the following
   methods:

   1.  Query String Serialization

   2.  Form Serialization

3.1.  Query String Serialization

   In order to serialize the parameters using the Query String
   Serialization, the Client constructs the string by adding the
   parameters and values to the query component using the
   "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format as defined by
   [W3C.REC-html401-19991224].  Query String Serialization is typically
   used in HTTP "GET" requests.

   Following is a non-normative example of such serialization:

     GET /authorize?scope=openid
       &response_type=code
       &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
       &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com

3.2.  Form Serialization

   Parameters and their values are Form Serialized by adding the
   parameter names and values to the entity body of the HTTP request
   using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format as defined by
   [W3C.REC-html401-19991224].  Form Serialization is typically used in
   HTTP "POST" requests.

   Following is a non-normative example of such serialization:

     POST /authorize HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

     scope=openid
       &response_type=code
       &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
       &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb

                 OpenID Connect Basic Client Profile 1.0      March 2013


4.  String Operations

   Processing some OpenID Connect messages requires comparing values in
   the messages to known values.  For example, the Claim Names returned
   by the UserInfo Endpoint might be compared to specific Claim Names
   such as "sub".  Comparing Unicode strings, however, has significant
   security implications.

   Therefore, comparisons between JSON strings and other Unicode strings
   MUST be performed as specified below:

   1.  Remove any JSON applied escaping to produce an array of Unicode
       code points.

   2.  Unicode Normalization [USA15] MUST NOT be applied at any point to
       either the JSON string or to the string it is to be compared
       against.

   3.  Comparisons between the two strings MUST be performed as a
       Unicode code point to code point equality comparison.

   In several places, this specification uses space delimited lists of
   strings.  In all such cases, only the ASCII space character (0x20)
   MAY be used for this purpose.

5.  TLS Version

   Whenever Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used by this
   specification, the appropriate version (or versions) of TLS will vary
   over time, based on the widespread deployment and known security
   vulnerabilities.  At the time of this writing, TLS version 1.2
   [RFC5246] is the most recent version, but has a very limited
   deployment base and might not be readily available for
   implementation.  TLS version 1.0 [RFC2246] is the most widely
   deployed version and will provide the broadest interoperability.

6.  Implementation Considerations

   This specification defines features used by Relying Parties using the
   OAuth "authorization_code" grant type.  These Relying Parties MUST
   implement the features that are listed in this specification as being
   "REQUIRED" or are described with a "MUST".

6.1.  Discovery and Registration

   Some OpenID Connect installations can use a pre-configured set of
   OpenID Providers and/or Relying Parties.  In those cases, it may not
   be necessary to support dynamic discovery of information about
   identities or services or dynamic registration of Clients.

   However, if installations choose to support unanticipated
   interactions between Relying Parties and OpenID Providers that do not
   have pre-configured relationships, they SHOULD accomplish this by
   implementing the facilities defined in the OpenID Connect Discovery
   1.0 [OpenID.Discovery] and OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration
   1.0 [OpenID.Registration] specifications.

7.  Security Considerations

   For security considerations other than those listed below, refer to
   the OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 [OpenID.Messages] and OpenID Connect
   Standard 1.0 [OpenID.Standard] specifications.

7.1.  TLS Requirements

   Implementations MUST support TLS.  Which version(s) ought to be
   implemented will vary over time, and depend on the widespread
   deployment and known security vulnerabilities at the time of
   implementation.  At the time of this writing, TLS version 1.2
   [RFC5246] is the most recent version, but has very limited actual
   deployment, and might not be readily available in implementation
   toolkits.  TLS version 1.0 [RFC2246] is the most widely deployed
   version, and will give the broadest interoperability.

   To protect against information disclosure and tampering,
   confidentiality protection MUST be applied using TLS with a
   ciphersuite that provides confidentiality and integrity protection.

   Whenever TLS is used, a TLS server certificate check MUST be
   performed, per RFC 6125 [RFC6125].

                 OpenID Connect Basic Client Profile 1.0      March 2013


8.  Privacy Considerations

   The UserInfo Response typically contains Personally Identifiable
   Information (PII).  As such, End-User consent for the release of the
   information for the specified purpose SHOULD be obtained at or prior
   to the authorization time in accordance with relevant regulations.
   The purpose of use is typically registered in association with the
   "redirect_uri".

   Only necessary UserInfo data SHOULD be stored at the Client and the
   Client SHOULD associate the received data with the purpose of use
   statement.

   The Resource Server SHOULD make the UserInfo access log available to
   the End-User so that the End-User can monitor who accessed his data.

   To protect the End-User from a possible correlation among Clients,
   the use of a Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID) as the "sub"
   (subject) SHOULD be considered.

                 OpenID Connect Basic Client Profile 1.0      March 2013


   o  Fixed introspection example to use id_token rather than access
      token.

   o  Removed asking for id_token in response type.

   o  Fixed Section 3 to be clear it is client secret that is maintained
      between the client and the OP.

   -06

   o  Only require the "token" flow in Lite.  Removed "code" flow.

   o  Make "id_token" required.  The "id_token" is treated as opaque.

   o  Rearranged sections for readability.

   o  Dropped the "schema" parameter to the Introspection endpoint,
      which was formerly a string with the value "user_id".  This is
      unnecessary since the "id_token" parameter already can be used to
      disambiguate the intended uses(s) of the endpoint.

   o  Dropped the requested audience from the Lite spec, which was
      formerly the identifier of the target audience of the response.
      This could be part of the Standard spec, but is an advanced
      scenario, and so not appropriate for Lite.

   o  Reference the Discovery and Registration specs, since they're
      needed for interaction between non-pre-configured parties (so that
      OpenID Connect installations can be Open).

   -05

   o  Corrected issues raised by Casper Biering.

   o  Created the OpenID Connect Lite specification.

   -04

   o  Correct issues raised by Pam Dingle and discussed on the mailing
      list after the 7-Jul-11 working group call.

   o  Adopted long_names.

   -03

   o  Correct issues raised by Johnny Bufu and discussed on the 7-Jul-11
      working group call.
