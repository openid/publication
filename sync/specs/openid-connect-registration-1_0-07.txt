       OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 - draft 07

Abstract

   OpenID Connect is an identity protocol that provides authentication,
   authorization, and attribute transmission capability.  It allows
   third party attested claims from distributed sources.  The
   specification suite builds on OAuth 2.0 and consists of Building
   Blocks (Messages, Discovery, Dynamic Client Registration, Session
   Management, JSON Web Token, JSON Web Signature, JSON WEB Encryption,
   JSON Web Keys, Simple Web Discovery), Protocol Bindings (e.g.,
   Standard and Basic Client) and Extensions.  This specification is the
   "Dynamic Client Registration" part of the suite that defines how
   clients register with OpenID Providers.

1.  Introduction

   In order for an OpenID Connect client to utilize OpenID services for
   a user, the client needs to register with the OpenID Provider to
   acquire a client ID and shared secret.  This document describes how a
   new client can register with the provider, and how a client already
   in possession of a client_id can retrieve updated registration
   information.

   The Client Registration endpoint may be co-resident with the token
   endpoint as an optimization in some deployments.

2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Refresh Token",
   "Authorization Code", "Authorization Grant", "Authorization Server",
   "Authorization Endpoint", "Client", "Client Identifier", "Client
   Secret", "Protected Resource", "Resource Owner", "Resource Server",
   and "Token Endpoint" that are defined by OAuth 2.0 [OAuth.2.0], and
   the terminology defined in the OpenID Connect Messages 1.0
   [OpenID.Messages] specification.

                OpenID Connect Registration 1.0 draft 07  September 2011


3.  Discovery

   OpenID Connect uses the registration_endpoint from the Provider
   Configuration Response Sec 4.2 [OpenID.Discovery].

4.  Client Registration Endpoint

   The Client Registration Endpoint returns registration information for
   the client to configure itself for the OpenID Provider.

4.1.  Request

   Clients MUST send requests encoded as a POST with the following
   parameters added to the HTTP request entity-body using "application/
   x-www-form-urlencoded" format:

   type  REQUIRED.  Values "client_associate", "client_update"

   client_id  OPTIONAL.  Used with "client_update"

   client_secret  OPTIONAL.  Used with "client_update"

   contact  OPTIONAL.  Space-separated of e-mail addresses for people
      allowed to administer the application.

   application_type  OPTIONAL. "native" or "web".

   application_name  OPTIONAL.  Name of the application to be presented
      to the user.

   logo_url  OPTIONAL.  URL that a logo for the application can be
      retrieved from.

   redirect_uri  OPTIONAL.  Space-separated list of redirect URIs

   js_origin_uri  OPTIONAL.  Space-separated list of JavaScript Origin
      URIs (used for Post Message flow)

   jwk_url  OPTIONAL.  URL for the RP's JSON Web Key [JWK]

   x509_url  OPTIONAL URL for the RP's PEM encoded X.509 Certificate or
      Certificate chain.

   sector_identifier  OPTIONAL URL to be used in calculating
      Pseudonymous Identifiers by the OP.  The URL contains a file with
      an array of redirect_uri values.

                OpenID Connect Registration 1.0 draft 07  September 2011


POST /connect/register HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Host: server.example.com

type=client_associate
&redirect_uri=https://client.example.com/callback https://client.example.com/callback2
&logo_url=https://client.example.com/logo.png

4.2.  Response

   The response is returned as a JSON object with all the parameters as
   top level elements.

   client_id  REQUIRED.  The unique client identifier.

   client_secret  REQUIRED.  The client secret.  This should change with
      each response.

   expires_in  REQUIRED.  The number of seconds that this id and secret
      are good for or "0" if it does not expire.

   The following is an example response.

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store

     {
       "client_id":"SlAV32hkKG",
       "client_secret":"cf136dc3c1fd9153029bb9c6cc9ecead918bad9887fce6c93f31185e5885805d",
       "expires_in":3600
     }

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

                OpenID Connect Registration 1.0 draft 07  September 2011


6.  Security Considerations

   Since requests to the client registration endpoint result in the
   transmission of clear-text credentials (in the HTTP request and
   response), the server MUST require the use of a transport-layer
   security mechanism when sending requests to the token endpoint.  The
   server MUST support TLS 1.2 as defined in [RFC5246], and MAY support
   additional transport-layer mechanisms meeting its security
   requirements.
