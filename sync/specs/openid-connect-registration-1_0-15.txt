       OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 - draft 15

Abstract

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   protocol.  It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
   based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
   well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
   interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This specification describes how an OpenID Client can obtain the
   necessary Client Credentials required by the OpenID Connect protocol
   suite.

1.  Introduction

   In order for an OpenID Connect Client to utilize OpenID services for
   a user, the Client needs to register with the OpenID Provider to
   acquire a Client ID and shared secret.  This document describes how a
   new Client can register with the provider, and how a Client already
   in possession of a "client_id" can retrieve updated registration
   information.

   The Client Registration Endpoint may be co-resident with the Token
   Endpoint as an optimization in some deployments.

   Note: This specification will likely be modified to use the OAuth
   Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [I-D.ietf-oauth-dyn-reg] once
   the OAuth registration draft is stable.  While currently self-
   contained, this specification intentionally uses the same syntax and
   identifiers as the current version of the OAuth registration draft as
   of the time that this specification was last updated.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are
   to be taken literally.  When using these values in protocol messages,
   the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Refresh Token",
   "Authorization Code", "Authorization Grant", "Authorization Server",
   "Authorization Endpoint", "Client", "Client Identifier", "Client
   Secret", "Protected Resource", "Resource Owner", "Resource Server",
   and "Token Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], and the terms
   defined by OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 [OpenID.Messages].

   This specification defines the following additional terms:

   Client Registration Endpoint  OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource through
      which a Client can request a new registration.

   Client Configuration Endpoint  The OAuth 2.0 Endpoint through which a
      specific Client can manage its registration information, provided
      by the Authorization Server to the Client.  This URL for this
      endpoint is communicated to the Client by the Authorization Server
      in the Client Registration Response.

   Registration Access Token  OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token issued by the
      Authorization Server through the Client Registration Endpoint that
      is used by the Client to authenticate itself during update
      operations.  This token is associated with a particular Client.

2.  Client Metadata

   Clients have metadata associated with their unique Client Identifier
   at the Authorization Server.  These can range from human-facing
   display strings, such as a Client name, to items that impact the
   security of the protocol, such as the list of valid redirect URIs.

   Client Metadata values used by OpenID Connect are:

   access_token  OPTIONAL.  Access Token obtained out of band to
      authorize the registrant.  This parameter MUST NOT be sent if the
      Access Token is sent in the HTTP Authorization header as described
      in Section 7.1 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].  Access Tokens sent in the
      authorization header must be bearer tokens [RFC6750].

   redirect_uris  REQUIRED.  Array of redirect URIs values used in the
      Authorization Code and Implicit grant types.  One of the these
      registered redirect URI values MUST match the Scheme, Host, and
      Path segments of the "redirect_uri" parameter value used in each
      Authorization Request.

   response_types  OPTIONAL.  JSON array containing a list of the OAuth
      2.0 "response_type" values that the Client is declaring that it
      will restrict itself to using.  If omitted, the default is that
      the Client will use only the "code" response type.

   grant_types  OPTIONAL.  JSON array containing a list of the OAuth 2.0
      grant types that the Client is declaring that it will restrict
      itself to using.  The grant type values used by OpenID Connect
      are:

      *  "authorization_code": The Authorization Code Grant described in
         OAuth 2.0 Section 4.1.

      *  "implicit": The Implicit Grant described in OAuth 2.0 Section
         4.2.

      *  "refresh_token": The Refresh Token Grant described in OAuth 2.0
         Section 6.

      *  "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer": The JWT Bearer
         grant type defined in OAuth JWT Bearer Token Profiles
         [OAuth.JWT].

      The following table lists the correspondence between
      "response_type" values that the Client will use and "grant_type"
      values that MUST be included in the registered "grant_types" list:

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0          March 2013


      *  "code": "authorization_code"

      *  "id_token": "implicit"

      *  "token id_token": "implicit"

      *  "code id_token": "authorization_code", "implicit"

      *  "code token": "authorization_code", "implicit"

      *  "code token id_token": "authorization_code", "implicit"

      If omitted, the default is that the Client will use only the
      "authorization_code" grant type.

   application_type  OPTIONAL.  Kind of the application.  The default if
      not specified is "web".  The defined values are "native" or "web".
      Web Clients using the OAuth implicit grant type MUST only register
      URLs using the "https" scheme as "redirect_uris"; they MAY NOT use
      "localhost" as the hostname.  Native Clients MUST only register
      "redirect_uris" using custom URI schemes or URLs using the "http:"
      scheme with "localhost" as the hostname.  Authorization Servers
      may place additional constraints on Native Clients.  The
      Authorization Server MUST verify that all the registered
      "redirect_uris" conform to these constraints.  This prevents
      sharing a Client ID across different types of Clients.

   contacts  OPTIONAL.  Array of e-mail addresses of people responsible
      for this Client.  This may be used by some providers to enable a
      Web user interface to modify the Client information.

   client_name  OPTIONAL.  Name of the Client to be presented to the
      user.  If desired, representation of this Claim in different
      languages and scripts is obtained by applying the rules set in
      Section 2.1.1.1.3 ("claims" member) of OpenID Connect Messages 1.0
      [OpenID.Messages].

   logo_uri  OPTIONAL.  URL that references a logo for the Client
      application.

   token_endpoint_auth_method  OPTIONAL.  Requested authentication
      method for the Token Endpoint.  The options are
      "client_secret_post", "client_secret_basic", "client_secret_jwt",
      and "private_key_jwt", as described in Section 2.2.1 of OpenID
      Connect Messages 1.0 [OpenID.Messages].  Other Authentication
      methods may be defined by extension.  If unspecified or omitted,
      the default is "client_secret_basic" HTTP Basic Authentication
      Scheme as specified in Section 2.3.1 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].

   policy_uri  OPTIONAL.  URL that the Relying Party Client provides to
      the End-User to read about the how the profile data will be used.
      The OpenID Provider SHOULD display this URL to the End-User if it
      is given.

   tos_uri  OPTIONAL.  URL that the Relying Party Client provides to the
      End-User to read about the Relying Party's terms of service.  The
      OpenID Provider SHOULD display this URL to the End-User if it is
      given.

   jwks_uri  OPTIONAL.  URL for the Client's JSON Web Key Set [JWK]
      document containing key(s) that are used for signing requests to
      the OP.  The JWK Set MAY also contain the Client's encryption
      keys(s) that are used by the OP to encrypt the responses to the
      Client.  When both signing and encryption keys are made available,
      a "use" (Key Use) parameter value is REQUIRED for all keys in the
      document to indicate each key's intended usage.

   sector_identifier_uri  OPTIONAL.  URL using the "https" scheme to be
      used in calculating Pseudonymous Identifiers by the OP.  The URL
      references a file with a single JSON array of "redirect_uri"
      values.  Please see Section 5.  Providers that use pairwise "sub"
      (subject) values SHOULD provide a "sector_identifier_uri".

   subject_type  OPTIONAL. "subject_type" requested for responses to
      this "client_id".  The "subject_types_supported" element of
      discovery contains a list of the supported "subject_type" values
      for this server.  Valid types include "pairwise" and "public".

   request_object_signing_alg  OPTIONAL.  JWS [JWS] "alg" algorithm
      [JWA] that MUST be required by the Authorization Server.  The
      valid values are listed in Section 3.1 of JWA [JWA].  All Request
      Objects from this "client_id" MUST be rejected if not signed by
      this algorithm.  Servers SHOULD support "RS256".

   userinfo_signed_response_alg  OPTIONAL.  JWS "alg" algorithm [JWA]
      required for UserInfo Responses.  The valid values are listed in
      Section 3.1 of JWA [JWA].  If this is specified the response will
      be JWT [JWT] serialized, and signed using JWS.

   userinfo_encrypted_response_alg  OPTIONAL.  JWE [JWE] "alg" algorithm
      [JWA] required for encrypting UserInfo Responses.  The valid
      values are listed in Section 4.1 of JWA [JWA].  If this is
      requested in combination with signing the response will be signed
      then encrypted.  If this is specified the response will be JWT
      [JWT] serialized, and encrypted using JWE.

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0          March 2013


   userinfo_encrypted_response_enc  OPTIONAL.  JWE "enc" algorithm [JWA]
      required for symmetric encryption of UserInfo Responses.  The
      valid values are listed in Section 4.2 JWA [JWA].  If
      "userinfo_encrypted_response_alg" is specified the default for
      this value is "A128CBC+HS256".  If this is requested in
      combination with signing the response will be signed then
      encrypted.  If this is specified the response will be JWT [JWT]
      serialized, and encrypted using JWE.

   id_token_signed_response_alg  OPTIONAL.  JWS "alg" algorithm [JWA]
      required for the ID Token issued to this "client_id".  The valid
      values are listed in Section 3.1 of JWA [JWA], with the exception
      of "none", which MAY NOT be used as the ID Token "alg" value.  The
      default if not specified is "RS256".  The public key for
      validating the signature is provided by retrieving the JWK Set
      referenced by the "jwks_uri" element from Discovery.

   id_token_encrypted_response_alg  OPTIONAL.  JWE "alg" algorithm [JWA]
      required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this "client_id".
      The valid values are listed in Section 4.1 of JWA [JWA].  If this
      is requested, the response will be signed then encrypted.  The
      default, if not specified, is no encryption.

   id_token_encrypted_response_enc  OPTIONAL.  JWE "enc" algorithm [JWA]
      required for symmetric encryption of the ID Token issued to this
      "client_id".  The valid values are listed in Section 4.2 of JWA
      [JWA].  If "id_token_encrypted_response_alg" is specified, the
      default for this parameter is "A128CBC+HS256".  If this is
      requested in combination with signing, the response will be signed
      then encrypted.  If this is specified, the response will be JWT
      [JWT] serialized, and encrypted using JWE.

   default_max_age  OPTIONAL.  Default Maximum Authentication Age.
      Specifies that the End-User must be actively authenticated if the
      End-User was authenticated longer ago than the specified number of
      seconds.  The "max_age" request parameter overrides this default
      value.

   require_auth_time  OPTIONAL.  Boolean value specifying whether the
      "auth_time" Claim in the "id_token" is REQUIRED.  It is REQUIRED
      when the value is "true".  The "auth_time" Claim request in the
      Request Object overrides this setting.

   default_acr_values  OPTIONAL.  Default requested Authentication
      Context Class Reference values.  Array of strings that specifies
      the default "acr" values that the Authorization Server MUST use
      for processing requests from this Client.  The
      "acr_values_supported" discovery element contains a list of the

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0          March 2013


      supported "acr" values supported by this server.  Values specified
      in the "acr_values" request parameter or an "acr" Claim request
      override these default values.

   initiate_login_uri  OPTIONAL.  URI using the "https" scheme that the
      Authorization Server can call to initiate a login at the Client.
      The URI MUST accept requests via both GET and POST.  The Client
      MUST understand the "login_hint" and "iss" parameters and SHOULD
      support the "target_link_uri" parameter.

   post_logout_redirect_uri  OPTIONAL.  URL supplied by the RP to
      request that the user be redirected to this location after a
      logout has been performed, as specified in OpenID Connect Session
      Management 1.0 [OpenID.Session].

   request_uris  OPTIONAL.  Array of "request_uri" values that are pre-
      registered by the Client for use at the Authorization Server.
      Servers MAY cache the contents of the files referenced by these
      URIs and not retrieve them at the time they are used in a request.
      OPs can require that "request_uri" values used be pre-registered
      with the "require_request_uri_registration" discovery parameter.

      If the contents of the request file could ever change, these URI
      values SHOULD include the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash value of
      the file contents referenced by the URI as the value of the URI
      fragment.  If the fragment value used for a URI changes, that
      signals the server that its cached value for that URI with the old
      fragment value is no longer valid.

3.  Client Registration

   The Client Registration Endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource
   through which a Client can request a new registration and manage the
   Metadata associated with it.  The OpenID Provider may require an
   Access Token that is provisioned out-of-band (in a manner that is out
   of scope for this specification) in order to restrict registration
   requests to only authorized Clients.

   In order to support open registration, the Client Registration
   Endpoint SHOULD accept registration requests without OAuth 2.0 Access
   Tokens.  These requests MAY be rate-limited or otherwise limited to
   prevent a denial-of-service attack on the Client Registration
   Endpoint.  If an Access Token is required for Client registration,
   the Client Registration Endpoint MUST be able to accept Access Tokens
   in the manner described in the OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750]
   specification.

3.1.  Client Registration Request

   To register a new Client to the Authorization Server, the Client
   sends an HTTP POST message to the Client Registration Endpoint with
   any parameters described in Client Metadata (Section 2) that the
   Client wishes to specify for itself during the registration.  The
   Authorization Server assigns this Client a unique Client Identifier,
   optionally assigns a Client Secret, and associates the Metadata given
   in the request with the issued Client Identifier.  The Authorization
   Server MAY provision default values for any items omitted in the
   Client Metadata.

   The Client sends an HTTP POST to the Client Registration Endpoint
   with a content type of "application/json" and all parameters as top-
   level members of a JSON object.

   For example, a Client could send the following registration request
   to the Client Registration Endpoint:

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0          March 2013


   The following is a non-normative example request (with line breaks
   within values for display purposes only):

     POST /connect/register HTTP/1.1
     Content-Type: application/json
     Accept: application/json
     Host: server.example.com
     Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJ ...

     {
      "application_type": "web",
      "redirect_uris":
        ["https://client.example.org/callback",
         "https://client.example.org/callback2"],
      "client_name": "My Example",
      "client_name#ja-Jpan-JP":
        "&#12463;&#12521;&#12452;&#12450;&#12531;&#12488;&#21517;",
      "logo_uri": "https://client.example.org/logo.png",
      "subject_type": "pairwise",
      "sector_identifier_uri":
        "https://other.example.net/file_of_redirect_uris.json",
      "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_basic",
      "jwks_uri": "https://client.example.org/my_rsa_public_key.jwks",
      "userinfo_encrypted_response_alg": "RSA1_5",
      "userinfo_encrypted_response_enc": "A128CBC+HS256",
      "contacts": ["ve7jtb@example.org", "mary@example.org"],
      "request_uris":
        ["https://client.example.org/rf.txt
          #qpXaRLh_n93TTR9F252ValdatUQvQiJi5BDub2BeznA"]
     }

3.2.  Client Registration Response

   Upon successful registration, the Client Registration Endpoint
   returns the newly-created Client Identifier and, if applicable, a
   Client Secret, along with all registered Metadata about this Client,
   including any fields provisioned by the Authorization Server itself.
   The Authorization Server MAY reject or replace any of the Client's
   requested field values and substitute them with suitable values.  If
   this happens, the Authorization Server MUST include these fields in
   the response to the Client.

   The response also contains a Registration Access Token that is used
   by the Client to perform subsequent operations upon the resulting
   Client registration.

   object.

   client_id
      REQUIRED.  Unique Client identifier.  It MUST NOT be currently
      valid for any other registered Client.

   client_secret
      OPTIONAL.  Client secret.  This MUST be unique for each
      "client_id".  This value is used by Confidential Clients to
      authenticate to the Token Endpoint as described in OAuth 2.0
      Section 2.3.1.  It is not required for Clients selecting a
      "token_endpoint_auth_method" of "private_key_jwt".

   registration_access_token
      REQUIRED.  Access Token that is used by the Client to perform
      subsequent operations upon the resulting Client registration.

   registration_client_uri
      REQUIRED.  Location where the Access Token can be used to perform
      subsequent operations upon the resulting Client registration.

   issued_at
      OPTIONAL.  Time when the Client Identifier was issued.  The
      timestamp value MUST be a positive integer.  The time is
      represented as the number of seconds since 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as
      measured in UTC.

   expires_at
      OPTIONAL.  Time at which the "client_secret" will expire or 0 if
      it will not expire.  The time is represented as the number of
      seconds since 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC.

3.3.  Client Registration Error Response

   When an OAuth error condition occurs, the Client Registration
   Endpoint returns an Error Response as defined in Section 3 of the
   OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750] specification.

   When a registration error condition occurs, the Client Registration
   Endpoint returns a HTTP 400 status code including a JSON object
   describing the error in the response body.

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0          March 2013


   The JSON object contains two members:

   error_code  Error code.

   error_description  Additional text description of the error for
      debugging.

   This specification defines the following error codes:

   invalid_redirect_uri  The value of one or more "redirect_uris" is
      invalid.

   invalid_client_metadata
      The value of one of the Client Metadata (Section 2) fields is
      invalid and the server has rejected this request.  Note that an
      Authorization Server MAY choose to substitute a valid value for
      any requested parameter of a Client's Metadata.

   The following is a non-normative example error response:

  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  Content-Type: application/json
  Cache-Control: no-store
  Pragma: no-cache

  {
   "error_code": "invalid_redirect_uri",
   "error_description": "The value of one or more redirect_uris are invalid."
  }

4.  Client Read

   This operation retrieves the Client Metadata for a previously
   registered Client.

4.1.  Client Read Request

   To read the current configuration of the Client on the Authorization
   Server, the Client makes an HTTP GET request to the Client
   Configuration Endpoint with the Registration Access Token, passing
   the "client_id" value as a query parameter.

   The following is a non-normative example request:

     GET /connect/register?client_id=s6BhdRkqt3 HTTP/1.1
     Accept: application/json
     Host: server.example.com
     Authorization: Bearer this.is.an.access.token.value.ffx83

4.2.  Client Read Response

   Upon a successful read operation, the Authorization Server SHOULD
   return all registered Metadata (Section 2) about this Client,
   including any fields provisioned by the Authorization Server itself.
   Some values, including the "client_secret" value, may have been
   updated since the initial registration.

   The Authorization Server need not include the
   "registration_access_token" or "registration_client_uri" value in
   this response unless they have been updated.

   The response is a JSON Document [RFC4627] with the Client Metadata as
   top-level members of a JSON object.

  }

4.3.  Client Read Error Response

   When a read error condition occurs, the Client Configuration Endpoint
   returns a HTTP 403 Forbidden status code.  This indicates that the
   Access Token is invalid or the Client record requested is invalid or
   non-existent.  Note that for security reasons, to inhibit brute force
   attacks, endpoints MUST NOT return 404 Not Found error codes.

5.  "sector_identifier_uri" Validation

   The sector identifier list provides a way for a group of Web sites
   under single administrative control to have consistent pairwise "sub"
   values, independent of their domain names, as described in Section
   2.8.1 of OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 [OpenID.Messages].  It also
   provides a way for Clients to change "redirect_uri" domains without
   having to re-register all of their users.

   The value of the "sector_identifier_uri" must be a URL using the
   "https" scheme that references a JSON file containing an array of
   "redirect_uri" values.  The values registered in "redirect_uris" MUST
   be included in the elements of the array, or registration MUST fail.

   The following is a non-normative example request to and reply from a
   "sector_identifier_uri".

     GET https://other.example.net/file_of_redirect_uris.json HTTP/1.1
     Accept: application/json
     Host: client.example.org

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: application/json
     Cache-Control: no-store
     Pragma: no-cache

       "https://client.example.org/callback2",
       "https://client.other_company.example.net/callback" ]

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0          March 2013


6.  String Operations

   Processing some OpenID Connect messages requires comparing values in
   the messages to known values.  For example, the member names in the
   Client registration response might be compared to specific member
   names such as "client_id".  Comparing Unicode strings, however, has
   significant security implications.

   Therefore, comparisons between JSON strings and other Unicode strings
   MUST be performed as specified below:

   1.  Remove any JSON applied escaping to produce an array of Unicode
       code points.

   2.  Unicode Normalization [USA15] MUST NOT be applied at any point to
       either the JSON string or to the string it is to be compared
       against.

   3.  Comparisons between the two strings MUST be performed as a
       Unicode code point to code point equality comparison.

   In several places, this specification uses space delimited lists of
   strings.  In all such cases, only the ASCII space character (0x20)
   MAY be used for this purpose.

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0          March 2013


7.  Validation

   If any of the validation procedures defined in this specification
   fail, any operations requiring the information that failed to
   correctly validate MUST be aborted and the information that failed to
   validate MUST NOT be used.

8.  Implementation Considerations

   This specification defines features used by both Relying Parties and
   OpenID Providers that choose to implement Dynamic Client
   Registration.  All of these Relying Parties and OpenID Providers MUST
   implement the features that are listed in this specification as being
   "REQUIRED" or are described with a "MUST".  No other implementation
   considerations for implementations of Dynamic Client Registration are
   defined by this specification.

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0          March 2013


9.  Security Considerations

   Since requests to the Client Registration Endpoint result in the
   transmission of clear-text credentials (in the HTTP request and
   response), all communication with the Registration Endpoint MUST
   utilize TLS.  See Section 9.1 for more information on using TLS.

   A rogue RP might use the logo for the legitimate RP, which it is
   trying to impersonate.  An OP needs to take steps to mitigate this
   phishing risk, since the logo could confuse users into thinking
   they're logging in to the legitimate RP.  An OP could also warn if
   the domain/site of the logo doesn't match the domain/site of redirect
   URIs.  An OP can also make warnings against untrusted RPs in all
   cases, especially if they're dynamically registered, have not been
   trusted by any users at the OP before, and want to use the logo
   feature.

   In a situation where the Authorization Server is supporting open
   Client registration, it must be extremely careful with any URL
   provided by the Client that will be displayed to the user (e.g.
   "logo_uri" and "policy_uri").  A rogue Client could specify a
   registration request with a reference to a drive-by download in the
   "policy_uri".  The Authorization Server should check to see if the
   "logo_uri" and "policy_uri" have the same host as the hosts defined
   in the array of "redirect_uris".

9.1.  TLS Requirements

   Implementations MUST support TLS.  Which version(s) ought to be
   implemented will vary over time, and depend on the widespread
   deployment and known security vulnerabilities at the time of
   implementation.  At the time of this writing, TLS version 1.2
   [RFC5246] is the most recent version, but has very limited actual
   deployment, and might not be readily available in implementation
   toolkits.  TLS version 1.0 [RFC2246] is the most widely deployed
   version, and will give the broadest interoperability.

   To protect against information disclosure and tampering,
   confidentiality protection MUST be applied using TLS with a
   ciphersuite that provides confidentiality and integrity protection.

   Whenever TLS is used, a TLS server certificate check MUST be
   performed, per RFC 6125 [RFC6125].

      The fix changed these names: user_id -> sub,
      user_id_types_supported -> subject_types_supported, user_id_type
      -> subject_type, and prn -> sub.

   o  Renamed "acrs_supported" to "acr_values_supported" for naming
      consistency.
