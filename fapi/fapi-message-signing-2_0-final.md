.# Abstract

OIDF FAPI 2.0 Message Signing is an API security profile for signing and verifying certain FAPI 2.0 Security Profile [@!FAPI2_Security_Profile] based requests and responses.

.# Foreword

The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) promotes, protects and nurtures the OpenID community and technologies. As a non-profit international standardizing body, it is comprised by over 160 participating entities (workgroup participant). The work of preparing implementer drafts and final international standards is carried out through OIDF workgroups in accordance with the OpenID Process. Participants interested in a subject for which a workgroup has been established have the right to be represented in that workgroup. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with OIDF, also take part in the work. OIDF collaborates closely with other standardizing bodies in the related fields.

Final drafts adopted by the Workgroup through consensus are circulated publicly for the public review for 60 days and for the OIDF members for voting. Publication as an OIDF Standard requires approval by at least 50% of the members casting a vote. There is a possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject to patent rights. OIDF shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.


.# Introduction

OIDF FAPI 2.0 is an API security profile based on the OAuth 2.0 Authorization
Framework [@!RFC6749]. This Message Signing Profile is part of the FAPI 2.0 family of specifications with a focus on providing interoperable support for non-repudiation across OAuth 2.0 based requests and responses. 

It has been formally analysed [@FAPI2MSANALYSIS] for it's security and non-repudiation properties.

# Message signing profile

OIDF FAPI 2.0 is an API security profile based on the OAuth 2.0 Authorization
Framework [@!RFC6749]. This Message Signing Profile aims to reach the security goals
laid out in the Attacker Model [@!attackermodel] plus the non-repudiation goals listed below.

All provisions of the [@!FAPI2_Security_Profile] apply to the Message Signing Profile
as well, with the extensions described in the following.


## Profile

In addition to the technologies used in the [@!FAPI2_Security_Profile], the
following standards are used in this profile:

  * OAuth 2.0 JWT Secured Authorization Request (JAR) [@!RFC9101] for signing authorization requests
  * JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode for OAuth 2.0 [@!JARM] for signing authorization responses 
  * OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection [@!RFC7662] with [@!RFC9701] for signing introspection responses

We understand that some ecosystems may only desire to implement 1, 2 or 3 of the above, it is therefore
anticipated that a piece of software will be able to conform to each of the methods separately, i.e. there
will be separate conformance testing options for each of the following:

 * Signed authorization requests
 * Signed authorization responses
 * Signed introspection responses 


## Non-repudiation

Beyond what is captured by the security goals and the attacker model in
[@!attackermodel], parties could try to deny having sent a particular message,
for example, a payment request. For this purpose, non-repudiation is needed.

In the context of this specification, non-repudiation refers to the assurance that the owner of 
a signature key pair that was capable of generating an existing signature corresponding to certain 
data cannot convincingly deny having signed the data ([@!NIST.SP.800-133]).

This is usually achieved by providing application-level signatures that can be
stored together with the payload and meaningful metadata of a request or
response. 

The following messages are affected by this specification:

  * NR1: pushed authorization requests
  * NR2: authorization requests (front-channel)
  * NR3: authorization responses (front-channel)  
  * NR4: introspection responses  
  * NR5: ID tokens

## Signing authorization requests

To support non-repudiation for NR1, pushed authorization requests can be signed. 
Because FAPI2 uses [@!RFC9126], NR2 is achieved by default when the pushed authorization request
is signed.


### Requirements for authorization servers

Authorization servers implementing FAPI2 authorization request signing

 1. shall support, require use of, and verify signed request objects according to JAR
    [@!RFC9101] at the PAR endpoint [@!RFC9126];
 2. shall require the aud claim in the request object to be, or to be an array containing, the authorization server's issuer identifier URL;
 3. shall require the request object to contain an `nbf` claim that is no longer than 60 minutes in the past; and
 4. shall require the request object to contain an `exp` claim that has a lifetime of no longer than 60 minutes after the `nbf` claim;
 5. shall accept request objects with `typ` header parameter with a value `oauth-authz-req+jwt`.

### Requirements for clients

Clients implementing FAPI2 authorization request signing

 1. shall send all authorization parameters to the PAR endpoint [@!RFC9126] in a JAR
    [@!RFC9101] signed requested object;
 2. shall send the `aud` claim in the request object as the authorization server's issuer identifier URL;
 3. shall send a `nbf` claim in the request object;
 4. shall send an `exp` claim in the request object that has a lifetime of no longer than 60 minutes;
 5. should send a `typ` header parameter with a value `oauth-authz-req+jwt`.

### Client metadata {#client-metadata}

The Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [@RFC7591] defines an API
for dynamically registering OAuth 2.0 client metadata with authorization servers.
The metadata defined by [@RFC7591], and registered extensions to it,
also imply a general data model for clients that is useful for authorization server implementations
even when the dynamic client registration protocol isn't in play.
Such implementations will typically have some sort of user interface available for managing client configuration.

The following client metadata parameter is introduced by this specification:

* `response_modes`: 
    * OPTIONAL. A JSON array of strings containing the list of response modes that
      the client may use. If omitted, the default is that the client may use any of
      the response modes supported by the authorization server.
 
## Signing authorization responses

To support non-repudiation for NR3, authorization responses can be signed. 

### Requirements for authorization servers

Authorization servers implementing FAPI2 authorization response signing

 1. shall support, require use of, and issue signed authorization responses via JWT Secured Authorization 
    Response Mode for OAuth 2.0 [@!JARM].

**NOTE**: When using [@!JARM] an authorization server should only include the iss authorization response 
parameter defined by [@!RFC9207] inside the JWT. This is because [@!RFC9207] defines `iss` 
to be an authorization response parameter, and [@!JARM] Section 4.1 requires all authorization 
response parameters to be inside the JWT.

### Requirements for clients

Clients implementing FAPI2 authorization response signing

 1. shall set the `response_mode` to `jwt` in the authorization request as defined in [@!JARM]; and
 2. shall verify signed authorization responses according to [@!JARM].


## Signing introspection responses

To support non-repudiation for NR4, introspection responses can be signed.

### Requirements for authorization servers

Authorization servers implementing FAPI2 introspection response signing

 1. shall sign introspection responses that are issued in JWT format according to [@!RFC9701]
 
### Requirements for clients

Clients implementing FAPI2 introspection response signing

 1. shall request signed token introspection responses according to [@!RFC9701]; and
 2. shall verify the signed token introspection responses.

## Signing ID tokens

To support non-repudiation for NR5, signed ID tokens are used.

### Requirements for authorization servers

No additional requirements. 

Note: Authorization servers implementing FAPI2 are already required to sign ID tokens as specified in section 5.4.1 in the [@!FAPI2_Security_Profile].
 
### Requirements for clients

Clients requesting and receiving ID tokens

1. shall verify the signature of the signed ID token received.
 
# Security considerations

## Authorization response encryption

In FAPI2, there is no confidential information in the authorization response, hence encryption of the authorization response is not required for the purposes of security or confidentiality. In addition, to achieve greater interoperability, it is not recommended to use encryption in this case. 

Usage of PKCE in FAPI 2 provides protection for code leakage described in Section 5.4 of [@!JARM].

## Confusion between resource servers and clients in introspection request

In [@!RFC9701], the resource server accessing
the introspection endpoint is seen in the role of a client towards the
authorization server that is providing the introspection endpoint. A malicious
client (that is not a resource server) could attempt to call the introspection
endpoint directly, and thus gather information about an access token to which it
is not supposed to have access. This may, for example, leak secrets including,
if the access token was leaked or stolen, personal information about an
end-user.

The authorization server therefore must ensure that the resource server is not
confused with a regular client that is not supposed to call the introspection
endpoint, and that the resource server has the necessary authorization to access
the information associated with the access token.

## Non-repudiation limited to individual messages

It is important to note that while this specification provides mechanisms for non-repudiation for 
individual messages, it does not provide non-repudiation guarantees for a sequence of messages.

## Non-repudiation not provided for front channel authorization requests

While only a small amount of information is present in a [@!FAPI2_Security_Profile] front channel 
authorization request, it is important to note that non-repudiation is not provided for this message. 

## Difficulty in linking a signed message to a real world identity

This specification provides the technical means to sign messages, however proving that a specific signed response is
linked to a specific real world end-user, or that a real world end-user initiated a specific request is outside of the
scope of this document.

## The value of JARM for non-repudiation

The values signed in a JARM response may be of limited value for non-repudiation as the values are artifacts 
of the OAuth flow (e.g. code and state) rather than real world values (e.g. account number and amount). However JARM
is still useful in providing message integrity to the authorization response.



# Privacy considerations

In addition to the privacy considerations detailed in [@!FAPI2_Security_Profile] implementers should consider
the privacy implications of storing messages for the purpose of non-repudiation. 

Such messages may well contain personally identifiable information and implementers should evaluate 
whether such messages need to be stored. If they are stored then adequate access controls must be 
put in place to protect that data. Such controls should follow data minimisation principles and ensure that 
there are tamper-proof audit logs.

# IANA considerations
## OAuth dynamic client registration metadata registration

This specification requests registration of the following client metadata
definitions in the IANA "OAuth Dynamic Client Registration Metadata" registry
established by [@RFC7591]:

### Registry contents

* Client Metadata Name: `response_modes`
* Client Metadata Description: Array of the response modes that the client may use
* Change Controller: IESG
* Specification Document(s): (#client-metadata) of this specification
