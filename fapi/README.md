# OpenID Foundation FAPI WG proposed publications 

Files proposed by FAPI draft editors should be added into this sub-directory via a branch that follows the pattern...
    propose/**

The proposed document sets should be as described in https://openid.net/wg/resources/naming-and-contents-of-specifications/

The automated checks that will be triggeerd by a push to this sub-directory and with the branch naming pattern above will indicate to the editors and to the OIDF secretary and their team whether there are issues that should be looked at prior to publication.  The automated checks only operate on the .html files that are submitted.  The source files should also be submitted with the same filename and extensions that may be .xml, .txt. or .md.
